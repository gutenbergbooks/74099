  <h2 class='c004'>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With the hope that we have succeeded in some measure in living
up to the high standard set by our honored predecessor, Thomas
Hamilton Murray, in the compiling of the Journal of the American
Irish Historical Society, we beg to offer Volume VIII.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is greatly to be regretted that the illness and death of Mr. Murray
made it impossible to issue a Journal for 1908, and that a break
was necessitated in the series of interesting and ably-edited publications
for which he was responsible. It is hoped, therefore, that
there will be found enough of interest in the records here submitted
to compensate in some small degree for the lapse of a year in the
spreading of the Society’s records before its members. The last
Volume by Mr. Murray was issued on December 31, 1907. Volume
VIII contains nothing of the records of the subsequent year except
the account of the annual meeting and dinner held at the Manhattan
Hotel, New York, January 29, 1908. This account was compiled
through correspondence with various members who were present at
that time.</p>

<p class='c008'>The present incumbent was appointed Acting Secretary-General of
the Society on November 18, 1908, by the President-General to
serve until the next annual meeting, January 16, 1909. At that
time he was formally elected to the office for the ensuing year.
There being no data previous to this election from which to compile
a chronological index for this Volume, its omission has been necessary.
Full accounts of all proceedings will be found, however, and
every address delivered at any event under the auspices of the Society
is given in full, everything of the sort having been reported stenographically
by the Society’s stenographer. Many events of direct
or indirect interest to our members have also been touched upon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Society is at the present time in a most prosperous condition.
Its financial status is satisfactory, and its membership is steadily increasing,
already numbering men of national and international prominence.
Its influence is rapidly becoming national, and the accomplishment
of its great primary object, “To Make Better Known the
Irish Chapter in American History,” seems assured.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PREAMBLE, CONSTITUTION AND BY-LAWS OF THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY ADOPTED AT THE ORGANIZATION MEETING JANUARY 20, 1897.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Preamble.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Believing that the part taken in the settlement, foundation and
upbuilding of these United States by the Irish race has never received
proper recognition from historians, and inspired by love for
the republic, a pride in our blood and forefathers and a desire for
historic truth, this Society has met and organized.</p>

<p class='c008'>Its mission is to give a plain recital of facts, to correct errors, to
supply omissions, to allay passion, to shame prejudice and to labor
for right and truth.</p>

<p class='c008'>While we as loyal citizens of this republic are earnestly interested
in all the various phases of its history, we feel that we should be
false to its honor and greatness and recreant to our own blood if
we did not make a serious effort to leave to those generations which
will follow us a clearer and better knowledge of the important work
done by men and women of the Irish race on this continent.</p>

<p class='c008'>People of this race—men and women born on Irish soil—have
been here from the first, prompted in their flight by the motives common
to all immigration, dissatisfaction with the old order of things
and the resolve to obtain a freer and better life in the new land
under new conditions.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so we have come together—natives of Ireland, American
sons of Irish immigrants, and descendants of immigrants even unto
the seventh, eighth and ninth American generations—to duly set
forth and perpetuate a knowledge of these things.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the days to come that lie in the womb of the future, when all
the various elements that have gone and are going to make the republic
great are united in the American—the man who in his person
will represent the bravest elements of all the old races of the earth—we
desire that the deeds and accomplishment of our element shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>be written in the book of the new race, telling what we did and no
more, giving us our rightful place by the side of the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>To accomplish this is the purpose of this organization. It is a
work worthy of the sympathy and aid of every American who can
rise above the environment of today and look into the broad future.
Fidelity, truth, honor are the watchwords of such a purpose, and
under their noble influences should our work be done.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ARTICLE II.<br> <span class='sc'>Objects and Purposes.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The objects and purposes of this Society are:</p>

<p class='c012'>(1) The study of American history generally.</p>

<p class='c013'>(2) To investigate, especially, the immigration of the people
of Ireland to this country, determine its numbers, examine the
sources, learn the places of its settlement, and estimate its influence
on contemporary events in war, legislation, religion, education and
other departments of human activity.</p>

<p class='c013'>(3) To examine records of every character, wherever found,
calculated to throw light on the work of the Irish element in this
broad land.</p>

<p class='c013'>(4) To endeavor to correct erroneous, distorted and false views
of history, where they are known, and to substitute therefor the truth
of history, based on documentary evidence and the best and most
reasonable tradition, in relation to the Irish race in America.</p>

<p class='c013'>(5) To encourage and assist the formation of local societies in
American cities and towns for the work of the parent society.</p>

<p class='c013'>(6) To promote and foster an honorable and national spirit
of patriotism, which will know no lines of division, which will be
based upon loyalty to the laws, institutions and spirit of the republic
to whose upbuilding the Irish element has unselfishly contributed in
blood and treasure, a patriotism whose simple watchwords will be
true Americanism and human freedom and which has no concern
for any man’s race, color or creed, measuring him only by his conduct,
effort and achievement.</p>

<p class='c013'>(7) To promote by union in a common high purpose a sincere
fraternity, a greater emulation in well doing, a closer confidence and
mutual respect among the various elements of the Irish race in
America, that by putting behind them the asperities of the past they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>may unite in a common brotherhood with their fellow citizens for
the honor of the race and the glory of the republic.</p>

<p class='c013'>(8) To place the result of its historical investigations and researches
in acceptable literary form; to print, publish and distribute
its documents to libraries, institutions of learning, and among its
members, in order that the widest dissemination of historical truth
may be obtained and placed within the reach of historians and other
writers and readers.</p>

<p class='c013'>(9) To sift and discriminate every paper, sketch, document bearing
on the Society’s line of work before the same is accepted and
given official sanction in order that its publication may be a guarantee
of historical accuracy; to do its work without passion or prejudice,
to view accomplished facts in the true scientific historical spirit
and having reached the truth to give it to the world.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ARTICLE III.<br> <span class='sc'>Membership.</span></h3>

<h3 class='c010'>GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The Society was organized on January 20, 1897, in Boston, Mass.,
and now has members in nearly all the states, the District of
Columbia, one territory and four foreign countries.</p>

<p class='c008'>The object of the organization is to make better known the Irish
chapter in American history.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are two classes of members—Life and Annual. The life
membership fee is $50 (paid once). The fee for annual members
is $5, paid yearly. In the case of new annual members, the initiation
fee, $5, also pays the membership dues for the first year.</p>

<p class='c008'>The government comprises a President-General, a Vice-President-General,
a Secretary-General, a Treasurer-General, a Librarian and
Archivist, a Historiographer and an Executive Council. There are
also State Vice-Presidents.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Society has already issued several bound volumes and a
number of other publications. These have been distributed to members,
public libraries, historical organizations and universities. Each
member of the Society is entitled, free of charge, to a copy of every
publication issued from the time of his admittance. These publications
are of great interest and value, and are more than an equivalent
for the membership fee.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Society draws no lines of creed or politics. Being an
American organization in spirit and principle, it welcomes to its
ranks Americans of whatever race or descent, and of whatever creed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>who take an interest in the objects for which the Society is organized.
Membership application blanks will be furnished on request to the
Secretary-General at his office, 49 Westminster Street, Providence,
R. I., or to John J. Lenehan, Chairman of the Committee on Membership,
71 Nassau Street, New York City. Blank applications
found at the end of this volume.</p>

<p class='c008'>The membership includes many people of prominence and occupies
a position in the front rank of American historical organizations.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Society is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the
State of Rhode Island and is authorized to take, hold and convey
real and personal estate to the amount of $100,000.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gifts or bequests of money for the uses of the Society are solicited.
We depend entirely on our membership fees and dues, and if we had
a suitable fund on hand its income would be most advantageously
used for historical research, printing and issuing historical works and
papers and adding to our library. The following is a form of bequest
good in any state or territory:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I give and bequeath to the American Irish Historical Society
—— dollars.”</p>

<p class='c008'>If desired, a donor or testator may direct the application of principal
or interest of his gift or bequest.</p>

<p class='c013'>The reception committee as designated by the Executive Council of the Society
comprises: T. P. Kelly, John F. Doyle and T. Albeus Adams of New
York; P. F. Magrath, Binghamton, N. Y.; James L. O’Neill, Elizabeth, N.

Hon. Thomas Z. Lee, Providence, R. I.; Hon. John Hannan, Ogdensburg,

<p class='c013'>Tickets for the dinner are now ready at $3.50 each. They can be obtained

<p class='c013'>Music will be furnished at the dinner by an orchestra and by a vocal

<p class='c013'>Members are at liberty to invite personal guests, and a large attendance

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A goodly number of members responded to the notice, and the
sale of tickets gave evidence that a large gathering would be present.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Reception Committee was early in attendance and rendered
much valuable service. It greatly assisted the Secretary-General,
who was ill, in the performance of his duties, introduced the new
members as they appeared and arranged the seatings of members for
the banquet.</p>

<p class='c008'>At 6.30 p. m. the annual meeting was called to order by Hon.
Thomas Z. Lee, in the absence of the President-General and Vice-President-General,
and, upon being elected President-General <em>pro
tem</em>, presided throughout the business meeting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Treasurer-General Dooley announced through the Chairman that
the funds of the Society were deposited in the Union Trust Company,
Providence, R. I., at the time of its suspension, and that a
plan for its reorganization had been suggested, but not yet adopted.
The funds were therefore not available for our use and he could not
tell when they would be. In order that the Society might have its
funds subject to its disposal and not be obliged to await a more or
less indefinite reorganization of the Union Trust Company, Mr.
Dooley had drawn his personal cheque for the total amount of our
detained funds and deposited same to the credit of the Society. He
asked that we give him an assignment of our money in the Union
Trust Company in order that he instead of us might do the waiting
and take the chances of being repaid.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Dooley’s generous offer was most cordially accepted, and a
committee appointed by the Chairman for that purpose immediately
executed the assignment of our detained funds as requested.</p>

<p class='c008'>Upon motion of Mr. Dennis H. Tierney, a vote of thanks was extended
Treasurer-General Dooley for the transaction above mentioned,
and remarks of a most complimentary nature were made
by several previous to the adoption of the vote.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>The annual report of the Secretary-General was read and it was
ordered that the same be received and placed on file.</p>

<p class='c008'>The annual report of the Treasurer-General showing receipts, disbursements
and balance on hand was read, and it was ordered that
the same be received and placed on file.</p>

<p class='c008'>A number of new members were elected, some of whom were present
later at the banquet.</p>

<p class='c008'>The election of officers for the ensuing year was called for, and
the following gentlemen, having the unanimous endorsement of
the Executive Council, were by ballot duly elected to the following
offices:</p>

others.</p>

<p class='c008'>President-General Quinlan opened the proceedings, and the Rev.
Dr. John J. McCoy said grace.</p>

<p class='c008'>A most eloquent speech was delivered by Mr. Henry J. Breen,
son of Hon. Matthew P. Breen, and he was followed by Hon. John
F. O’Connell of Providence, who spoke concerning the Sullivan Memorial
and the work of the Society in Rhode Island.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rev. Dr. John J. McCoy was then introduced, and his discourse
was graceful, eloquent and learned, and a beautiful tribute to the
work of the Society.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hon. Patrick J. Ryan of Elizabeth, N. J., told in a most interesting
manner of the growth of New York and of his experiences
as a boy romping about on the present site of the hotel where the
banquet was held.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. T. Vincent Butler of New York made a short speech about
our fellow-member, President Roosevelt, and proposed a toast to
his health, which was drunk amid much enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. M. F. Sullivan of Lawrence, Mass., gave a number of very
practical suggestions as to how the membership of the Society could
be increased and the sphere of its work extended.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. David Healy of New York spoke of the supreme importance
of the work of the Society in centering the light of organized, intelligent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and painstaking research upon Ireland’s part in the making
of American history; of her contributions to America’s greatness,
and the proud place which has been honorably won by her children
as an integral part of American life, American ideals, and American
nationality.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One of the great disadvantages with which the Irish element in
American life has had to deal,” said Mr. Healy, “has been the fact
that histories and school text-books, current in the English speaking
world, have been too largely the product of minds influenced and
prejudiced by inherited anti-Irish animosities and pro-English traditions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Irish have been considered as pre-eminently a martial race
because of their persistent and unconquerable struggles for a score
of generations to vindicate the principle of Irish nationality.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is true that the Celtic race has also been universally awarded
an exalted place in the realm of poetry, oratory and song, as well
as in devotion to family and in faithfulness to principle. It remains
for the American Irish Historical Society to show other and equally
important and admirable characteristics of the Irish race, and to
point to other fields wherein Irishmen have distinguished themselves
in meeting the current and pressing problems of America’s rapid and
unparalleled development.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It remains for us to realize and to show to others that not only
was it the Irishman’s pick that brought the earth’s hidden treasures
to the surface, his shovel that made ready for the iron rail across
the continent, but it was Irish brain and enterprise largely that developed
the mines and constructed the steel pathway between the
East and the West, thus making a national unit qualified and competent
to deal with the nations of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the great life current of American nationality, the rich red
blood of the Celt has been a dominant and fructifying tributary.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It also remains for us to realize our shortcomings and to aim
for the highest ideals, not to be content with a leading place in the
world of military renown, financial, industrial and commercial enterprise.
We should earnestly seek correspondingly high places in the
realm of philanthropy, moderation and universal brotherhood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>During the evening the Sullivan Memorial Committee having in
charge the erection and dedication of a bronze memorial at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>State House in Rhode Island to Maj.-Gen. John Sullivan, made a
report through Judge Lee, its chairman, showing substantial progress
and an intention to dedicate the memorial some time during
the present year.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Dennis H. Tierney made stirring remarks concerning “The
Star Spangled Banner” as a patriotic song taken as a whole, and deplored
the disposition of so many public bodies to leave out parts
of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>After remarks by other members the company dispersed, having
participated in one of the most entertaining and instructive banquets
ever held by the Society.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>An event of much historical significance to Rhode Island, and
indeed to the entire country, took place under the auspices of the
Society at the Rhode Island State House on Wednesday, December
16, 1908, when an impressive bronze memorial was dedicated
to the memory of Major-General John Sullivan, one of Rhode Island’s
Revolutionary heroes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The memorial, which most appropriately commemorates the services
of General Sullivan to his race, his country and his State, is
placed in a fitting position in the broad corridor of the main entrance
to the capitol. Large, beautifully designed and in every way
worthy of its mission, it immediately claims the attention of everyone
who enters the State House. It has already been the object
of favorable comment from many distinguished people, and is acknowledged
to be a credit not only to the memory of the distinguished
soldier, but also to the Society through whose efforts it
was placed in its present position.</p>

<p class='c008'>The exercises on the day of the unveiling were in every way
worthy of such an occasion. People of distinction in every walk
of life were present, all the historical organizations of the State
were represented by officers and members, and addresses befitting
the event were delivered by men of prominence in public life and
in historical research. Col. David C. Robinson, of New York, a
well-known student of history and a most eloquent speaker, was the
orator of the day, and inspiring speeches were made by Dr. Francis
J. Quinlan, of New York, President-General of the Society;
Gov. James H. Higgins, of Rhode Island; Governor-elect Aram
J. Pothier; ex-Governor Charles Warren Lippitt; Mayor Patrick
J. McCarthy, of Providence; and Gen. William Ames, chairman
of the State House Commission. Hon. Thomas Z. Lee, of Providence,
chairman of the Sullivan Memorial Committee, presided.
The exercises took place in the presence of a large gathering and
one thoroughly representative of the public and social life of the
city and State.</p>

<p>MR. THOMAS ZANSLAUR LEE,<br>  <br>  Secretary-General of the American Irish Historical Society.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Following the dedicatory exercises luncheon was served at the
Narragansett Hotel, the Society’s headquarters, and this also was
followed by a number of brief addresses from well-known Rhode
Islanders and members of the Society from other States.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proceedings at the State House began at noon, Judge Lee
making the opening address. He said:</p>

<p class='c017'>“<em>Honored Guests, Members of the American Irish Historical Society,
Ladies and Gentlemen</em>:</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are assembled in the Rhode Island State House today to
dedicate a memorial in honor of Maj. Gen. John Sullivan whose
service to the country and this State during the war of the Revolution
is familiar to every American, and whose career as a soldier,
statesman and jurist will be eloquently depicted by those who will
be presented to you later. My remarks will be confined to a short
history of the American Irish Historical Society under whose auspices
the memorial was erected, and a reference to the movement
and spirit which prompted the work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The American Irish Historical Society was organized in Boston,
January 20th, 1897. Certain gentlemen interested in historical
work, believing that proper recognition had not always been given
by historians and others to the part taken in the settlement, foundations,
upbuilding and general affairs of the United States by those
of Irish descent, brought forth the idea of a society, national in
its scope, that should be devoted to making better known the Irish
Chapter in American history, by giving plain recitals of facts, correcting
errors, supplying omissions, discouraging prejudice, establishing
right and truth, and giving rightful place and just due to
historical matters concerning American citizens of Irish nativity,
blood or extraction. Invitations were sent out by these gentlemen,
and an enthusiastic meeting took place, at which representatives
from seventeen States were present; and the following were elected
the first officers of the Society:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rear Admiral Richard Worsam Meade, U. S. Navy, of Washington,
President-General; Mr. Osborne Howes of Massachusetts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Vice-President-General; Hon. John C. Linehan of New Hampshire,
Treasurer-General; Thomas Hamilton Murray of Rhode Island,
Secretary-General; and Thomas B. Lawler of New York,
Librarian and Archivist.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The first Executive Council consisted of the foregoing and Mr.
James Jeffrey Roche of Boston, Hon. Robert Ellis Thompson of
Philadelphia, Hon. Theodore Roosevelt of New York, Hon. Edward
A. Moseley of Washington, Mr. Augustus St. Gaudens of
New York, Mr. Joseph Smith of Lowell, T. Russell Sullivan, a
direct descendant of General Sullivan, of Boston, and Hon. Maurice
F. Egan of Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The first Board of State Vice-Presidents was as follows:
Maine, Mr. James Cunningham of Portland; New Hampshire, Mr.
T. P. Sullivan of Concord; Vermont, Mr. Thomas W. Moloney of
Rutland; Massachusetts, Mr. Osborne Howes of Boston; Rhode
Island, Mr. M. Joseph Harson of Providence; Connecticut, Mr.
Joseph F. Swords of Hartford; New York, General James R.
O’Beirne of New York City; New Jersey, Hon. William McAdoo,
Assistant Secretary of the Navy, of Jersey City; Pennsylvania,
General St. Clair A. Mulholland of Philadelphia; South Carolina,
Ex-United States Senator M. C. Butler of Edgefield; Georgia,
Ex-United States Senator Patrick Walsh of Atlanta; Ohio, Rev.
George W. Pepper of Cleveland; Illinois, W. J. Onahan of Chicago;
Michigan, Ex-Congressman Thomas A. E. Weadock of Detroit;
Minnesota, Mr. Daniel W. Lawler of St. Paul; Missouri, Mr.
Richard E. Kerens of St. Louis; District of Columbia, Mr. J. D.
O’Connell of Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The work that the Society has undertaken is worthy of the sympathy
and aid of every American who is interested in the past, present
and future of this, the greatest country on earth; and in doing
its work the watchwords of the Society are Fidelity, Truth and
Honor, and we feel and know what the influence and inspiration of
these words mean.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One of the preambles in the Constitution reads: ‘While we as
loyal citizens of this Republic are earnestly interested in all the various
phases of its history, we feel that we should be false to its
honor and greatness and recreant to our own blood if we did not
make a serious effort to leave to those generations which will follow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>us, a clearer and better knowledge of the important work done by
men and women of the Irish race in the United States.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The broad scope of our work may be comprehended from a
statement of our objects and purposes:</p>

<p class='c012'>“(1) The study of American history generally.</p>

<p class='c013'>“(2) To investigate, especially, the immigration of the people of
Ireland to this country, determine its numbers, examine the sources,
learn the places of settlement; and estimate the influence on contemporary
events in war, legislation, religion, education and other departments
of human activity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“(3) To examine records of every character, wherever found,
calculated to throw light on the work of the Irish element in this
broad land.</p>

<p class='c013'>“(4) To endeavor to correct erroneous, distorted and false views
of history, where they are known, and to substitute therefor the truth
of history, based on documentary evidence, and the best and most
reasonable tradition, in relation to the Irish race in America.</p>

<p class='c013'>“(5) To encourage and assist the formation of local societies in
American cities and towns for the work of the parent Society.</p>

<p class='c013'>“(6) To promote and foster an honorable and national spirit of
patriotism, which shall know no lines of division, which shall be
based upon loyalty to the laws, institutions and spirit of the Republic
to whose upbuilding the Irish element has unselfishly contributed
in blood and treasure, a patriotism whose simple watchwords shall
be ‘true Americanism’ and ‘human freedom,’ and which has no
concern for any man’s race, color or creed, measuring him only by
his conduct, effort and achievement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“(7) To promote by union in a common high purpose, a sincere
fraternity, a greater emulation in well doing, a closer confidence
and mutual respect among the various elements of the Irish race
in America, that by putting behind it the asperities of the past, it
may unite in a common brotherhood with its fellows for the honor
of the race and the glory of the Republic.</p>

<p class='c013'>“(8) To compile the results of its historical investigations in
suitable literary form; to print, publish and distribute its documents
among libraries, educational institutions and its own membership
with a view to the wide dissemination of historical truths, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>order that such data may be placed within the reach of historians
and other writers and readers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“(9) To discriminate every paper, sketch and document bearing
on the work of the Society before the same is accepted and given
official sanction, in order that its publication may be a guarantee
of its historical accuracy; to do its work without passion or prejudice,
to view acknowledged facts in the true scientific historical
spirit; and, having reached the truth, to give it to the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some two years ago the movement for the erection of this memorial
was started. The first suggestion came from Mr. Thomas Hamilton
Murray, the late honored Secretary-General of the Society.
The Rhode Island members at once manifested a deep interest,
formed themselves into a committee, and, in due time, solicited
among their number subscriptions for this memorial. These subscriptions
came in very satisfactorily, and, when we were assured
that it was possible to erect a suitable memorial, a sub-committee of
the general committee conferred with the Board of State House
Commissioners, who assigned to us the most appropriate space in
the State House, beside the cases of flags carried by Rhode Island
regiments in the different wars.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The memorial has been erected with the aid of Rhode Island
subscriptions, with one or two exceptions. It was designed by the
brilliant young sculptor, Mr. John G. Hardy, under whose direction
it was executed by the W. J. Feeley Company, of Providence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I now take great pleasure in behalf of the American Irish Historical
Society and in behalf of its committee, in presenting to the
State of Rhode Island the Sullivan memorial, which Mr. Hardy
will now unveil. (At this point the flags draping the memorial were
drawn aside by the sculptor.)</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now I have the great honor to present to you a gentleman
well-known and highly-honored by all Rhode Islanders, one who
has shown deep interest in this, as in all other worthy projects,
Hon. James H. Higgins, Governor of Rhode Island.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Governor Higgins spoke as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<em>Ladies and Gentlemen</em>: In behalf of the State of Rhode Island,
I am not only pleased but proud indeed to accept this splendid memorial.
Rhode Island has a particular interest in the career and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>achievements of General Sullivan. He was delegated to the command
of the forces in Rhode Island largely through the recommendation
of General Greene, the greatest soldier of all in the Revolution
next to Washington. Through the joint recommendations
of Washington and Greene, Sullivan was placed in command of the
forces in this State.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There was perhaps no State in the Union which, in proportion
to its size and population, suffered more of the hardships of that
great struggle than our own. Some historians have suggested that
one section of our State, Newport and the Island of Rhode Island,
have never recovered from the blow dealt it through the long occupation
of that section of the State by the British forces. We of
Rhode Island, therefore, have a particular interest in the efforts
of General Sullivan to expel the British from this State.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are proud, therefore, to know that the American Irish Historical
Society has taken this matter up and has shown such active
interest in perpetuating the memory and the exploits of General
Sullivan. I am sure that I can say on behalf of our united citizenship
that the State appreciates this activity, this patriotism, on the
part of the American Irish Historical Society, and we want to say
to you, sirs, that the fruit of your interest—this memorial—will ever
be preserved by our State as a remembrance of his splendid achievements,
as well as of the generosity and the patriotism of the organization
which prompted it. May your activity, my friends, be continued
throughout the length and breadth of the land and throughout
the entire period of your career in the same creditable and patriotic
manner that has characterized your work concerning General
Sullivan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Again, sirs, I am pleased to accept in behalf of our State this
splendid remembrance, to assure you of our profound appreciation,
and to say that it shall ever remain as a memento of your patriotism
and character, of the gratitude and appreciation of our good State,
as an inspiration to all future generations and to all visitors to this
splendid Capitol, of the value and eternity of that thankfulness
which a grateful people feel for those who serve them well.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is now my pleasure to turn the memorial over to General
William Ames, the Chairman of the State House Commission, in
whose trustworthy hands this monument will be placed and from
whom I am sure it will receive the same careful and patriotic attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>that all his other duties have received in connection with the
management of our splendid State Capitol. I am pleased, therefore,
to introduce to you one of our most honored fellow citizens, General
William Ames, who will accept in behalf of the State House Commission.”</p>

<p class='c007'>General Ames responded as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<em>Your Excellency, Members of the American Irish Historical
Society, Ladies and Gentlemen</em>: As Chairman of the Commission
having in its care and keeping this beautiful State House it is my
privilege to bid you welcome here today. We are assembled, not
for an ordinary occasion, but for an extraordinary one. We are here
to inscribe upon this marble wall the name of one who was patriot,
soldier and statesman, the commander who planned and fought the
Battle of Rhode Island in 1778.</p>

<p class='c013'>“General John Sullivan passed on long years ago to make his
final report to the great Commander of us all. Yet we have treasured
his memory, and through the years it has grown ever dearer
to the hearts of all patriotic Americans—to us of Rhode Island more
than all. And now that love has found fitting expression in this
memorial, which shall commemorate through the coming ages his
patriotism, his devotion, and his loyal services to his country.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A State can perform no more graceful act than to make public
record of the deeds and accomplishments of its famous sons. It
therefore gives me great pleasure, and I deem it a high honor, to
accept for the State House Commission the custody and care of the
beautiful memorial placed upon these walls by the American Irish
Historical Society.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the conclusion of General Ames’ acceptance Chairman Lee
introduced Mayor McCarthy in the following words: “The thanks
of the American Irish Historical Society are due and are hereby tendered
to General Ames and to Hon. James M. Scott and Col. J. Edward
Studley, the other members of the Board of State House Commissioners,
for their great courtesy to us. It was to them we first
addressed ourselves for permission to place our memorial to General
Sullivan in the State House, and when it was ready for its
permanent position a few weeks ago, we went to them again concerning
the dedicatory exercises. Our comfortable seating was provided
for, the freedom of this beautiful capitol extended us and an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>ample force of employees placed at our disposal. We may well
be grateful for the uniform courtesy and consideration that marked
all the Commission’s dealing with our Society.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Secretary of our committee is a very worthy member of the
Society. As I happened to be the Chairman, it was my privilege
to sign my name over his in issuing the invitations. It is the first
time I have ever had an opportunity of putting my name before
that of His Honor the Mayor, and I enjoyed the opportunity.
But now, after doing his work as Secretary of the committee very
faithfully, he has tendered his resignation, which we have most
regretfully accepted, in order that he might do his duty as Chief
Executive of the City of Providence. I have the honor to introduce
to you our esteemed fellow-member, Hon. Patrick J. McCarthy
of Providence, who will, I am sure, extend to us a warm welcome
to the principal city of the State over the destinies of which
he presides so ably.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mayor McCarthy said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<em>Mr. Chairman, Fellow Members of the American Irish Historical
Society, Ladies and Gentlemen</em>: I am deeply sensible of the
honor my official position and duty brings me on this occasion as
Mayor of Providence in greeting the representatives of The American
Irish Historical Society and its distinguished guests from
many states; I tender you a ‘Providence Welcome,’ and the freedom
of the city.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank the Society for its munificent gift of the beautiful
bronze memorial, which commemorates the heroic deeds of Major
General John Sullivan of the Continental Army and his services
to his native State (New Hampshire) as citizen, legislator, jurist
and governor, and also to the United States as a member of Congress.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The people of Providence thank the State House Commissioners
for allotting space for the memorial in the Capitol Building of
Rhode Island; it is an appropriate place for a memento of the hero
of the Battle of Rhode Island. The good deeds of men live after
them. General Sullivan’s life was spent in the service of his state
and country. He was generously endowed by nature, with the mental
and physical qualities that are characteristic of his race, which
enabled him to perform his duty on the field, on the bench, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>chief magistrate of his State, and as a citizen, courageously and
zealously with loyalty to God and country—seeking honor only in
the discharge of duty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The history of his life work survives him. We are assembled
to honor his memory. The memorial you have this day placed in
this State House is a page in bronze, of the history of the early
struggles of our countrymen for National Independence, equal
rights, and freedom—a page which future generations will read
with inspiration to emulate the honorable career of General Sullivan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We honor ourselves in dedicating this monument to his memory.
Providence is grateful to the Society for possession of it within
the city, and is modestly proud of the fact that it is the product
of a Providence artist and establishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The dedication of permanent monuments in grateful recognition
of the noble service of good men inspires others to heroic deeds
and sacrifices, and perpetuates the history of such men and their
achievements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The American Irish Historical Society, in placing this beautiful
memorial in Rhode Island, commemorates one of the early battles
in support of the Declaration of Independence and for national
separation of the Colonies from Great Britain, fought by an American
General of the Irish race, ever loyal to the cause of freedom
and equality and commends the history of his life, and the history
of the Irish race in America to all men of good will.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Chairman Lee: “A generous response to our invitations has
been received, nearly all our invited guests being present. We have
received letters of regret, however, from Rev. W. H. P. Faunce,
President of Brown University, Hon. Asa Bird Gardiner, Rt. Rev.
Mathew Harkins and one or two others whose letters are not this
moment before me. Our fellow-member, the President of the United
States, in a letter to us, tenders his regrets at being unable to
be present, and cites urgent business at home as the reason. Judging
from the accounts in the morning papers about his trouble with
the yellow journals, I take it he is pretty busy at this time in Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We have letters of regret from other members of the Society
who are unable to be present. I will read the names only. Rt.

ceremonies here; delegates of all the organizations represented in response
to our invitation are also cordially invited to join us at luncheon.
The headquarters are in room 10 at the hotel, and luncheon
will be served in the main dining-room immediately upon our arrival
there.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Society is fortunate in having secured for the principal
speaker today a gentleman who knows perhaps more about the life
and works of General Sullivan than does any other in the United
States; a statesman whose record is widely known, and whose voice
has been heard in discussion of historical and other matters in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>New York capitol at Albany on many occasions. The son of a
former governor of New York, he has always been identified with
New York institutions and New York laws. Through his efforts
the Legislature of that State recently appropriated $10,000 for the
purpose of erecting a suitable memorial to General Sullivan, and,
while the purposes of that resolution have not yet been fulfilled,
it will be but a short time before a fitting tribute is paid by the State
of New York to the memory of Major General Sullivan. And the
credit for that tribute will be due in large part to the gentleman
I now have the honor to introduce, Col. David C. Robinson, of
Elmira, N. Y.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Robinson spoke as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<em>Mr. Chairman, Your Excellency the Governor, Members of the
American Irish Historical Society, Ladies and Gentlemen</em>: I should
do less than justice to the emotions of the hour if I did not, at the
outset, express my high appreciation of and my profound thanks for
the honor done me in the invitation from your Society to voice our
mutual sentiments upon so important an occasion as this. It is an
honor to be invited as a spectator to take part in such a ceremony as
this; it is a higher honor to be accounted worthy even by a few to
say a word on such an occasion; it is honor most of all that I have
your unanimous invitation to say that which I may be able to in
memory of one of the noblest and purest characters on whom the
sun of history has ever shone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It has been the habit of my life, my friends, to speak without a
note; the professional training of many years has made it easier.
I do remember many, very many things about Major General John
Sullivan and his life; I do not remember all that I should mention,
for the line is long, and I am, therefore, contrary to my usual
custom, obliged to ask you to bear with me while I refresh my recollection
from time to time with a memorandum of some of the most
distinguished services with which this man’s life was filled, to the
end that I may impress the lesson which speaks from this memorial,
which speaks from the long-drawn procession of brave and good
and kind deeds with which the life of the one whom we commemorate
today is surrounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And first, before I enter on that which I would say of this memorial
and of him to whose memory it is dedicated, I want to congratulate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>this Society on that which it has even in the few years of
its existence accomplished, and on the labors, increased in volume
every year, by which it makes known the Irish chapter in American
history.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To trace that which we owe to the line of blood of which this
man was one of the most illustrious examples, is a duty which belongs
to every student of American history. Let us find, if we
may, wherein lay that in which he so far exceeded most of his
fellowmen. Let us make it a lesson not alone to say that this man
was one of the greatest of American Irish or Irish Americans, but
that he illustrated a trait of character which Americans and Irish
American citizens all ought to follow, ought to teach their children
to follow, ought to endeavor to perpetuate in the thoughts, the work,
the labors of this land.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now we are met principally to do honor to the memory and the
merits of a brave and good man; that is our purpose; but in our
acts and words today, my friends, we do honor not only to him
and to his memory, but we do honor to ourselves and our countrymen.
He belongs to us and we appreciate it. The laurels which
we lay on the graves of such as he, who periled life, limb, fortune,
happiness and health that we might enjoy the blessings which are
ours today, are laurels piled upon our own characters, our own
qualities.</p>

<p class='c013'>“From this beautiful tablet, so fittingly placed in honor of him,
whose name in this hour fills all our hearts, the veil has just fallen
in your sight. I do not envy that American who, at such a time as
this, does not feel his heart swell with patriotic pride at the thought
of what this graven monument means to us and ours.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A thousand recollections sparkle in the chambers of memory as
we recall the chivalry, the worth, the dauntless courage and self-denying
loyalty of him whose heart, stilled in its own earthly tenement
for more than a hundred years, yet lives and throbs and pulses
in the hearts of every lover of his land and of human liberty the
wide world around; and, although appreciating to the fullest extent
all that your Mayor has so well said and the Chairman so
ably suggested of the beauty of this memorial, I may be pardoned
for saying that no work of art, no accomplishment of high design,
no costly metal, no skilful chiseling, no beautiful moulding, can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>make a memorial worthy of such a man as was Major General John
Sullivan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For when I think of what he was and what he did, when there
rises to my sight the sacrifice and effort, the combat and the stern
endurance, the privation and the grief, the sorrow and the pain,
which marked his labor and his life throughout the years which
spanned the rise of freedom, yea, the hope of men upon this continent,
I feel sure that pen may not write, voice may not sound, nor
can the chisel of art produce token worthy of his high deserving.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I would that the task of voicing our sentiments upon this occasion,
the impressions of this hour, had fallen to other and to abler
hands than mine. I wish that some peerless orator, born of that
great race from which he sprang, might tell us here whence came
the greatness, the nobility, the grace and loveliness which were so
gloriously his, and, in telling that, might teach our children how
he came to that high state of manly quality which all the world
now knows was his.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, friends of this great Society, whose well-bent efforts have
done so much to give deserving heroes the credit which was rightly
theirs, I know you will not let the awakened and quickening memories
of this great soul for one moment hesitate in their progress
toward wider and better appreciation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know that my own shortcomings will be more than complemented
by your larger opportunity of bringing within the circle
of his admirers every patriotic citizen of this Republic. Nay, more,
I hope the day will come when every State House in the land
shall hold a tablet such as this, when every schoolboy shall read
lessons from his life, when every human being who seeks partnership
and title in the freedom of his kind shall, in his memory,
cherish the name of Major General John Sullivan as one who deserves
a niche unshadowed and a fame unscarred among the scanty
array of those great souls whom the genius of Liberty proudly calls
her own.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is not the fulsome word of hyperbole; it is not the sounding
tinkle of rhetoric or idle eulogy. It is the measured testimony
of those who have read aright the history of the great struggle for
Independence, and have found therein no light or shadow in which
the great soul of Major General Sullivan did not sparkle with the
luster of a flawless diamond. And in this hour, beneath the lofty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>dome henceforth to shadow this memorial, in this free atmosphere
which seems even now to echo with the guns he fired against his
country’s foes, in this bright light, not purer than the soul he wore
upon his sleeve, let us trace out a few of those strands of character
which made him what he was, and, in our speaking, draw some
inspiration from a few of the many debts which Liberty and our
common country owe to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, my friends, the account is long. We find him early trained
as a lawyer, and at the age of 32 Major of the New Hampshire
Regiment; in the spring of 1774, a member of the Provincial Assembly
of New Hampshire; in September of the same year and
in 1775, a delegate to the Continental Congress, by which he was
in June, 1775, appointed a Brigadier-General, and in 1776 a Major-General.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yet even while he was, at 34, only a New Hampshire Major,
he had accomplished perhaps the most daring personal feat of
the Revolution in the seizure of the powder and arms at Fort
William and Mary in Portsmouth Harbor. Do you realize what
that meant? Little more than a boy, anticipating, as he always anticipated,
troubles to come, he dealt a crushing blow to the greatest
power on earth, a boy with a dozen companions, and he sounded
in that one daring act the keynote of that grand chorus of Liberty
whose majestic final chords were heard in the surrender of Cornwallis
at Yorktown.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I challenge the world to find a busier or more useful life than
his for the five years from 1774 to 1779. No wonder, my friends,
that no memorial can do justice to this. We find him on Winter’s
Hill at the siege of Boston, working with all the energy of a vigorous
manhood and high purpose; again at Portsmouth to advise
and assist in warding off a menaced attack from the British fleet;
thence hastily ordered to New York to aid General Putnam with
a powerful detachment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The pressing needs of the imperiled American army in Canada
caused General Washington, in the spring of 1776, to hurry him
off with six regiments to join its Commander at the earliest possible
moment. Do you realize, my friends, what a journey to Canada
with six regiments—a hasty journey—meant in those days? Yet
Sullivan was there, only to see the death of the Commander whom
he had been ordered to assist, from a malignant attack of smallpox;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>and himself suddenly succeeded to the place of Chief Commander
of the entire expedition.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing could exceed the vigor and discretion of his work as
Commander of this most difficult expedition. Washington wrote
of him at this time—and I love to quote of this man who has always
been my historical ideal the words of the greatest mind in
war and peace this country has ever known—Washington wrote of
him at this time: ‘He is active, spirited and zealously attached to
the cause. His wants are common to us all. He wants experience
to move upon a grand scale, for the limited and contracted knowledge
which any of us have in military matters stands in very little
stead.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“But Washington’s most competent biographer, Washington Irving,
declares with emphasis and truth: ‘This want was overbalanced
on the part of General Sullivan by sound judgment, some
acquaintance with men and books, and an enterprising genius.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is a source of profound regret to the thoughtful student of
American history that General Sullivan was not left in charge to
work out the problem of the Canadian expedition. True, he was
only thirty-six years of age and had had but limited experience,
but his successful combinations of a few years later leave it more
than possible that, with him as a leader, the whole of Canada might
have been added to the United States even at that early day, and
the Revolution there terminated in half the time it finally lasted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This was not destined so to be, for Congress somewhat hastily
decided to commit the command of the Northern army to the much
older but, as many of us now believe, far less competent hands of
General Gates. I should not do justice to General Sullivan’s character
if I did not concede that this replacement caused him some
hurt, and I might say grief, but his magnanimous and instant efforts
in the very moment of his return from Canada to serve his
country by taking up as temporary Commander the perilous work
on Long Island which General Greene had been compelled by illness
to lay down, showed the soldier, the gentleman and patriot
as no less trying circumstances could.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the midst of the carnage of the disastrous battle of Long Island,
Sullivan was taken prisoner. At once paroled and soon after
exchanged, we find him in December, 1776, hastening to join General
Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“Let me now turn from the track of this all too historical resumé
to call your attention to the fact that, when Lord Howe paroled
General Sullivan, desirous then of accelerating and possibly
terminating the Rebellion without severance with the colonies, he
selected John Sullivan as the honored representative of the British
Government to convey his message to George Washington, and General
Sullivan, under his own parole, brought from Lord Howe to
George Washington the propositions which Lord Howe felt he
could entrust to no more worthy hands than those of this man who
was the absolute and the untiring enemy of Great Britain. That
is a testimonial to General Sullivan whose place no monument can
take.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In December, 1776, he hastened to join General Washington.
On the morning of the attack of Trenton, after a night of storm
and cold so bitter that some of his men were frozen to death and
many of his guns were rendered wet and useless, he reported to
Washington the defective condition of his muskets, as was his duty,
but was ordered to advance and charge, which he did with so much
effect that his regiment was really the first in action at the lower
end of the town.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Next we find him, September 11th, 1777, on the disastrous but
glorious field of Brandywine, every duty discharged with promptness,
cool courage and sound discretion and judgment, and even in
the closing hours of that struggle his was the foremost figure in
the desperate center of the fray.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Brandywine and its disappointing finish was scarcely over before
the conflict at Germantown involved him with his division in another
desperate struggle, where an unfortunate and needless delay
by General Knox and the sudden rising of a dense and impenetrable
fog snatched from his hands a victory earned and well earned
by every exhibition of soldierly quality a commander could give.
And even in the hour of keenest personal disappointment, balked
of a victory he had richly earned, a victory which would have set
his name ringing around the world as its chief author and cause,
his thoughts were not of himself, but of the personal danger to
Washington to whom he gave the lifelong devotion which only lives
in the breasts of noble men.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Without a pang or plaint of his own peril and disappointment,
he writes: ‘I saw with great concern our brave Commander-inChief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>exposing himself to the hottest fire of the enemy in such a
manner that regard for my country obliged me to ride to him and
beg him to retire.’ And in the longer account of which these words
are a part, my friends, not a suggestion can be found or guessed
of the added peril which the writer himself freely braved in the efforts
to remove his Chief from danger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This hasty and inadequate resumé of his service in the first two
years of the Revolution brings us to the great military operation of
which he was the chief and on which will always rest much of his
fame—the investment of Rhode Island and the series of movements
of which the State and coast of Rhode Island formed the picturesque
theater.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The enterprise was a favorite one with Washington, who hoped,
indeed, that it would emphasize the French alliance at the outset
by an overwhelming and successful effect of an attack on the
British army almost within the sound of our voices. Its success
was very dear to Washington’s heart, and for it he chose three officers
perhaps more closely in his confidence and affection than any
others in the Revolutionary Army. Sullivan was in chief command,
with Greene and Lafayette as equal subordinate assistants, each having
a division comprising as nearly as possible half of the army.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The plan of operations had been agreed upon between Washington
and the French Commander, and the conflict was laid out to be,
as it should have been, the first great effort of the allied French
and American forces against the British army of invasion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am speaking to an audience whose youngest members should
and probably do know more of the details of these military movements
than I can ever hope to know.</p>

<p class='c013'>“From first to last, down to the finest particular of necessary
prevision, General Sullivan was more than ready. All that a commander
could do to insure success, he had accomplished so well that
the only criticism made of his actions was that he had seized the
British works opposite the north end of the island one day ahead
of time. At this, the French General who had expected a joint
attack to be made the next day professed to believe his notions of
military etiquette had been shocked, but, as no harm resulted and a
distinct gain in time had been effected, he had small foundation
for his complaint, which was soon practically abandoned.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There had been an excellent opportunity to make the joint undertaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>a magnificent success. If, as is now apparent, the attack
had been made in the latter part of July as it might easily have been
in view of Sullivan’s perfect preparations and the presence of the
French fleet, it is probable that the war would have reached a complete
and glorious close almost within sight of the ground upon
which we stand today. Postponed as it was from day to day until
August 10th, the British were given time to reinforce their fleet,
hasten it to Newport, and there engage the French fleet in dilatory
manœuvering which used up days of precious time and completely
dissipated all hope of substantial assistance from the French warships.
The expected, or that which should have been expected by
the naval commanders, soon happened; many of us who have spent
much time around here would have expected it to happen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“About the twentieth of August, one of those storms for which the
region of Point Judith is famous, set in with almost unexampled
fury. Land and water forces were alike put out of condition for
offensive or defensive operations. The French fleet limped away to
Boston to refit, and Sullivan, deeply chagrined at the utter failure
of his naval auxiliaries to render any assistance, set to work to protect
his army and extricate it from a position made perilous by the
departure of its entire marine support and the consequent desertion
of most of his militia.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The story of his great achievement in retiring his entire force in
the face of a vastly superior English army, of the masterly retreat
covered by his most skilfully selected position at Butts Hill, as I
believe it is called—as to its proper name, I shall not attempt to
correct a Rhode Island audience—a retreat effected finally so completely
that not a man was left behind and not a single article lost,
while, in the course of that retreat, signal and marked punishment
was inflicted upon the British army, will ever read like a romance
of model leadership, and, if General John Sullivan had no other
memory, my friends, than of what he did within a radius of sixty
miles of this Capitol, his fame could be no less great and no less
enduring than it is, and, what is more, would be richly deserved.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thus briefly, as becomes my scanty time, I have sketched the work
of John Sullivan to the close of 1778. I have not made the motive
of my story clear if it has not already appeared that this man was
greater in the hour of undeserved disappointment than most men
in the exaltation of victory. Again and again, the fruits of deserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>and brilliant success were held to his lips, only to be dashed away
by the folly of the foibles of some weaker spirit necessarily entangled
in his plans. Yet never for an instant did he yield to the despair
and mortification which would have sunk less noble souls.
Each disappointment seemed to but nerve him to stronger and more
brilliant efforts. And herein, my friends, to my mind, is illustrated
and should be made prominent one grand characteristic which we
have taken from the noble Irish race. The patience under disappointment
which Major General John Sullivan illustrates, the patience
under disappointment which again and again was manifestly
the fault of men to whom he never gave a word of rebuke or complaint,
the steadfast iron determination with which he set to work
instantly to repair the ruin that some, associated in common with
him, had wrought, is the brightest leaf in the chaplet which America
has put upon his grave.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is an honor to belong to that grand old race, aye, even to hold
one drop of Irish blood in your veins, but, good friends all, with
or without it, I am proud to testify to what Irish friendship, Irish
loyalty and the matchless Irish courage can do. No man ever knew
as I have known what Irish friendship is, no man ever knew as I
have known what Irish hospitality is, no man ever knew as I have
known what Irish loyalty and patience is, without bowing in humble
respect to it, whether he drew his blood from France or from Russia,
from America or from England, each one of which owes Ireland a
measureless debt. And all who love truth in history and gratitude
for priceless gifts received, will urge your Society onward every day
and hour you labor in the work you have so well begun till every
heroic son of this great line who has helped to build the fabric of
American liberty shall have his rightful place in history and the
laurels he has fairly won.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have now come to that which, in justice to Major General
John Sullivan, I think should be related. I shall ask you to turn
from the beautiful State in which you live to that far off region of
beauty in which I have the honor to hold my home. In 1778 occurred
in Wyoming that awful massacre whose horrors yet ring in
the history of our country and in the hearts of the descendants of
those who lost part of their families, who lost limb, who lost
health, who were maimed, in that most horrible of savage invasions.
Early in 1779 Congress, representing a country which had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>shocked to the limit by those terrible outrages, passed a resolution of
unlimited vigor, calling upon Washington to arrange for their punishment.
It was suggested at first to Washington that General
Gates should have the command, but Washington, whose knowledge
of Indian warfare was complete, wanted General Sullivan, and to
that officer was entrusted the conduct of that great fight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the history of Indian warfare in this country there is nothing
more successful, more thoroughly creditable to the commanding officer,
than the history of what General John Sullivan and his command
did in the then wilderness reaching from Wyoming to the
Genesee; and today, think of him what you may, build to him tablets
as beautiful as this, recall his manifestly skilful work in the
State where you stand, and you cannot accord to him one half the
veneration and the love which the citizens of the counties around me,
now a million in number, feel towards General John Sullivan for
the work which opened up that magnificent line of valleys unequalled
in their fertility, and whose line of bordering hills to this day, one
hundred and thirty years after, is resounding with thanksgiving and
praise for what General John Sullivan did there.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Every morning when I look out of my window in the far distance
I can see in the battlefield which decided the ownership of
that region a tall and stately monument built by private subscription
to General Sullivan, to commemorate his work on that bloody day,
and just below it stands a magnificent marker of granite, placed
there by the Sons of the American Revolution to mark the very center
of the conflict which took those valleys away from the possession
of the Indians and turned them over to civilization and happy and
peaceful occupation; and those who know the iron will and determined
character of John Sullivan know, as we do, that when he
got through with the Indians and their worthless white associates
they had no more thirst for blood. Sullivan served notice on them
and carried it out that if there was any more blood shed in that
part of the country the Indians would furnish the blood.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So perhaps, in an humble way, I have alluded to that feature of
Sullivans’ life—his closing campaign, which identifies him with
Northern Pennsylvania and Central New York.</p>

<p class='c013'>“With the close of the campaign of 1779, which may be said to
have terminated his military career, General Sullivan resigned his
commission and retired from the army. The constant strain of five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>years almost constantly in active and perilous service had wrecked a
constitution never of the strongest, and he felt he had given all of
his life and strength to the cause of Independence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“His resignation was accepted with profound regret, although it
was universally felt that the reasons for his retirement were imperative.
Although he lived for fifteen years after his resignation, his
health was not robust and he died in 1795 at the early age of fifty-four,
universally admired and lamented. He had, however, no
sooner left the army than his brilliant legal and forensic talent was
seized upon, for such services to the country as his health would
permit, in the legislative halls of the nation, the executive chair of
his own State, and later upon the Federal Bench.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In 1780–1781 he was a delegate to Congress. In 1782 he was appointed
the Attorney-General of New Hampshire and was re-appointed
to that office on the adoption of the new constitution of that
State in 1784.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In 1786–1787 he was President and Chief Magistrate of the State
of New Hampshire, an office equivalent to that of Governor at the
present time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In 1788 he was speaker of the House of Representatives of New
Hampshire and President of the Convention that ratified the Constitution
of the United States.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In 1789 he was a presidential elector and voted for General
Washington for President of the United States, and in March of the
same year he was elected Chief Magistrate of the State for the third
time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Later in 1789 he was appointed by Washington, his affectionate
friend and admirer during his whole life, as Judge of the United
States District Court of New Hampshire, an office which he held
with honor to himself and the Judiciary until his death in January,
1795.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have thus briefly sketched the outline of a life which deserves
an autobiography perfect in every detail and of the highest grade.
History shows this man in more varied and brilliant lines than almost
any character in Revolutionary annals. Consider him, my
friends, as a young lawyer, prompt, keen, resourceful and competent,
and you have a model of early professional life. Mark him as
an active officer of the line, reckless of danger, ready to dare all
that could be dared, willing to do all that he had dared. Mark him
again as a commanding general, reliable, faithful, prudent and
dauntless, unswerved by passion, unstained by chagrin, unmarred by
envy and uninfluenced by clamor, steady and well-poised in the hour
of peril or in a moment of undeserved injustice. Consider him
again, my friends, when after years of fierce combat he is chosen for
the command of such an expedition as I have indicated, which needs
great skill in combination and with such resources in provision for
the needs of a frontier army that his success seems impossible.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“And here let me digest for a moment words which, in my own
hearing, fell from the lips of the distinguished General Slocum,
speaking of General Sullivan’s great Indian campaign in the presence
of General Sherman thirty years ago on the one hundreth anniversary
of the same. General Slocum said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘As I have sat listening to the speeches today, I have drawn a
parallel between those two expeditions. Sherman’s march was the
longer of the two, but, in many respects, he had greater advantages.
While he had a great distance to travel he had roads made for him
by the enemy; he had his produce brought by mule trains; while
General Sullivan made his march through trackless woods and carried
his provisions upon the backs of his soldiers. Sherman had
good arms; General Sullivan had the old flintlock musket. But
after all, the spirit which prompted both expeditions was the same.
It was bold and daring, and, although there was no great loss of life
in either, yet the results of both were far greater than many battles
in which lives by the thousand and tens of thousands were lost.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“And on the same occasion—it is my excuse for quotations, my
friends, that I want you to hear these words from two of the greatest
Generals we have ever known—on the same occasion, remembering
then, as we remember today, how unjustly General Sullivan was
at one time criticised for the harshness of his treatment of the Indians
on the Susquehanna expedition, remembering, too, that he suffered
these criticisms in silence rather than to lay the blame upon his
beloved Chief, Washington, who had given him the orders which
were condemned, I quote from the words of General Sherman,
spoken also in my hearing on the same occasion:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Our fathers, when they first landed upon this continent, came to
found an empire, based upon new principles, and all opposition to it
had to pass away, whether it were English or French on the north,
or Indians on the west; and no one knew it better than our father,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Washington. He gave General Sullivan orders to come here and
punish the Six Nations for their cruel massacre in the valley of Wyoming,
and to make it so severe that it would not occur again. And
he did so. General Sullivan obeyed his orders like a man and like a
soldier, and the result was from that time forward your people
settled up these beautiful valleys around here, and look at their descendants
here, a million almost. If it had not been for General Sullivan
and the men who followed him from Easton, and Clinton’s
forces that came across from Albany, probably some of you would
not have been here today.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“I still read: ‘Battles are not measured by their death roll, but
by their results, and it makes no difference whether one man was
killed or five hundred if the same result follows. This valley was
opened to civilization. It came on the heels of General Sullivan’s
army, and has gone on and gone on until today. The same battle is
raging upon the Yellow Stone. The same men endowed by the
same feelings that General Sullivan’s army had today are contending
with the same causes and the same races two thousand miles west
of here, not for the purpose of killing, not for the purpose of shedding
blood, not for the purpose of doing wrong at all, but to prepare
the way for that civilization which must go along wherever yonder
flag floats.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“It might be thought perhaps, my friends, that this rehearsal of
the opinions of General Sherman and General Slocum, two of the
greatest military leaders of our country, might have been more properly
used here than on the dedication of a tablet somewhat, in its
scope as a memorial, limited to your own State, but it has been my
purpose, my friends, to illustrate General Sullivan as one of the most
admirable representatives of his race; and when I have set before you
a parallel drawn in the presence of General Sherman himself between
the difficulties and the success of Sullivan’s march from Wyoming to
the Genesee and Sherman’s own march to the sea, and have given
you the opinions of both General Sherman and General Slocum, I
have illustrated my proposition that of all the debts which America
owes to Ireland, God bless her, General John Sullivan, in his varied
talents, in that which he accomplished, in every spot and place in
which we put him, is entitled to rank with the noblest and purest
contribution which we, in America, have from the grand old Irish
race.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“My friends, my words are in substance ended. I have detained
you longer than I meant to, but they who live around me could
have told you that you have only to mention the name and memory of
Major-General John Sullivan to set going any thoughtful student
of American history who lives in the magnificent valleys of the Susquehanna,
the Wyoming, and the Genesee. What we owe to this
man we can never repay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am proud and happy to have been allowed to participate in the
unveiling of such a tribute as this. As I said at the outset, I hope
the day will come when every State House in this land will have one,
and yet, when I think of what he was and what we owe him, I feel
that no monument can make him greater than he is in the affections
of our people a hundred and thirty years after his death. And yet
I am proud for our own sake, for the uplifting of our own people,
that we have thus recognized that which we know of his worth. I
might have spoken in his behalf with truth the words of the great
Roman: ‘<i><span lang="la">Exegi monumentum aere perennius</span></i>’—‘I have builded a
monument more enduring than brass.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Former Governor Lippitt was the next speaker, introduced by the
Chairman as follows: “One of our invited guests, representing the
Society of the Cincinnati, is obliged to go to a neighboring city within
the next hour to deliver an address, and we will not have the pleasure
of his company at our luncheon or the benefit of any words from
him afterwards. I will therefore introduce him at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As General Sullivan was one of the original members of the Society
of the Cincinnati, it is singularly fitting that we call on an honored
Rhode Islander, whose father as well as himself has served the
state as Governor, and whose devotion to the history and affairs of
the commonwealth has given him a well deserved position as an authority
on his subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It gives me great pleasure to introduce Hon. Charles Warren
Lippitt, ex-Governor of Rhode Island.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Chairman, Members of the American Irish Historical Society,
Ladies and Gentlemen: I feel surprised at finding myself somewhat
unexpectedly in this position, but will try to aid in honoring this
occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Veneration for General Sullivan, for his services on the Island
of Rhode Island, and for his noble victory, has always been mine.
That he was of Irish extraction, and that his ancestors, like those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>of all the rest of us who are not descended from Indians, emigrated
from a home land to this new country in the western hemisphere, is
well known. My descent is from the English, with a strain of the
French and the German races rather than from the Irish. No one
in any way familiar with American history can hesitate an instant
in according to the Hibernians the honor of many noble actions and
the respect due to sacrifice of untold value, in every emergency of our
common country.</p>

<p class='c008'>“General Sullivan came of a sturdy race. His father was born
during the siege of Limerick, away back in 1691, of such good stock
that he outlived the century and did not pass away until 1796, at the
age of one hundred and five. It was his son that gave so much of his
life and energy, his intelligence and ability, to the cause of American
freedom. That he served with distinction in the Continental Army
goes without question. That he was at Trenton the night before
Christmas and aided in the defeat and capture of that hated Hessian
contingent that had been marauding up and down New Jersey is
also an established fact. It is equally true that with the three Rhode
Island regiments, forming a material part of Washington’s army,
he braved the elements in that historic night march from Trenton to
Princeton, fought the next morning in the battle of Princeton, and
successfully assisted in driving Cornwallis out of New Jersey. It
was the crisis of the Revolution. In that time of stress and doubt
John Sullivan, the descendant of an Irishman, like so many others of
his race, stood shoulder to shoulder with the descendants of the English
and the French in securing for us and the millions that have inhabited
this land the priceless privileges of liberty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“His course in the Genesee Valley and the very proper punishment
he administered to the savages who committed the horrible massacre
at Wyoming has been eloquently traced. His campaign in Rhode
Island has, perhaps, been studied in rather more detail in this neighborhood
than in other parts of the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>“History records and practically every American schoolboy can tell
how the Americans fought at the battle of Bunker Hill. Wherever
the Revolution is known there is an intimate knowledge of that great
conflict. We all of us glory in its story, and remember with gratitude
and sympathy the bravery of those untrained patriots who administered
such a fearful blow to British power and prestige.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Compare for a moment the battle on Rhode Island and the results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>secured by Sullivan’s generalship with the circumstances and
the issue on that hill near Boston. The loss of the English at Bunker
Hill was 1,054 men, that of the Americans 449. Until the British
entered the redoubt, the Americans fought behind entrenchments.
In the third attack the British captured the redoubt, drove the
Americans from the hill, and retained undisputed control of the battlefield.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the campaign on Rhode Island the inability of the French to
control the sea obliged the Americans to retire to Butts Hill. In
the valley separating it from Quaker, Turkey and Anthony hills,
immediately south, a battle was fought, not behind entrenchments,
but in the broad open, where each army had equal advantages and
success was won by brilliant tactics and skill and spirit in using
weapons. In the retreat and in the battle between the nearby Rhode
Island hills, the English lost 1,023 and the Americans 211. After
repulsing two vigorously and pertinaciously pressed charges of the
English army, the Americans were obliged in the early afternoon to
face a last violent onset that almost broke the right wing of Sullivan’s
army under the immediate command of General Greene. Jackson’s
regiment connected with Colonel Livingston’s detachment, that
had contested during the early morning the British advance up the
island, after a needed rest on the north side of Butts hill were
marched around the rear of the army, by Sullivan’s direction, to the
extreme right of General Greene’s command. The British and Hessians
charged down the slope of Anthony hill and were met in the
valley by Greene’s somewhat exhausted forces. It was the final
struggle for victory. At this critical moment Colonel Livingston led
Jackson’s regiment, using the cold steel, in a fierce onslaught against
the enemy’s flank that gave the British the final blow and sent them
scurrying up the slope of Anthony hill to their entrenchments on the
top. The Americans, closely following the flying foe, captured
Brady’s battery as an evidence of their victory.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Americans maintained absolute control of the battlefield.
Colonel Campbell of the Twenty-Second British Regiment sent to
General Sullivan the day after the battle and asked permission to
search among the dead for the body of his nephew, who had been
killed the day before by his side, but whose body he could not remove
they were so closely pursued.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Battle of Rhode Island was a gratifying success for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Americans. Victory was due to the skill, the intelligence, the courage
and the audacity of General Sullivan, and to his brave officers
and men. Lafayette characterized it as ‘the best fought action of the
war,’ and the statement accords the highest compliment to the military
skill of General John Sullivan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a great pleasure to participate with so many friends in expressing
our high appreciation of the services of Sullivan that have
been so adequately and happily recognized by the American Irish
Historical Society. It is an intense gratification to contemplate the
success of these ceremonies and to sincerely join in congratulation
and in commendation of efforts that have resulted in adorning this
noble State House with this beautiful, substantial and enduring tablet
to our heroic dead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>President-General Quinlan of the Society was then introduced by
the Chairman, as follows: “I have the pleasure now to call upon
the President-General of the American Irish Historical Society, under
whose careful and enthusiastic administration it has been possible
to erect and dedicate this tablet. There never has been a time when
his efforts, his energy, and all his powers were not at our disposal.
There never has been a time when we have called on him for anything
since the memorial has been under way that he has not promptly and
vigorously responded. I have the great honor of introducing to
you, ladies and gentlemen, our President-General, Francis J. Quinlan,
M. D., L. L. D., of New York City.”</p>

<p class='c007'>President-General Quinlan said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Chairman, your Excellency, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Before I attempt to say a few words in honor of the auspicious
event of this day, I will take occasion to render the tribute of
my personal thanks and of the collective thanks of our Society to
the distinguished assemblage gathered here to do honor to our illustrious
hero by the loyal support of their presence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I take occasion, first of all, to thank the Ex-Governors, the present
Governor, the Governor-elect, and the Department of the G. A. R.,
an association that to me is representative of the rarest and choicest
texture of the loom of American Independence. (I would rather
wear their button than be decorated by one hundred kings.) To
those who represent the Society of Colonial Wars I extend my heartfelt
thanks for their presence. To the Daughters of the American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Revolution and to the distinguished Sons, as well as to the Sons of
Veterans and also the illustrious Society whose early achievements in
this country need no word of commendation from me,—the Society
of the Cincinnati,—to them and to their representatives I extend my
thanks and my greetings. To the Rhode Island Citizens’ Historical
Association I also offer welcome. To those who are associated
with none, but whose attendance is due to their interest in these exercises,
I am thankful for their presence here today.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, ladies and gentlemen, you have heard the stirring notes of
welcome that have rung out in this beautiful building, the tributes
that have been paid by those gentlemen, one of them with a line of
nine generations of pure and unsullied English blood. What further
tribute do we need, what other ratification or emphasis do we
require than that which comes from one whose nation held us in subjugation,
with its heel of tyranny upon our neck, for seven hundred
years, when this offspring, eager to forget past enmities, frankly
tells us in tones of eloquence that the Irish have been and always will
remain loyal and true and constant and devoted to every cause they
espouse! We need but little further argument to justify our existence,
but it behooves me, on an occasion of this kind, not apologetically,
but in bold words, to explain the purpose of the American
Irish Historical Society.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It has been truly said by the Chairman of this meeting that this
Society was born in the City of Boston in the year 1897, for the study
of American history generally, as well as to trace the immigration of
the people of Ireland to this country, to correct erroneous and distorted
views of history in relation to the Irish people in America, and
to encourage and promote the formation of local associations in
American cities and towns as aids in the work of the parent Society.
These purposes have been so enlarged upon by the Chairman that
they need no word of encouragement from me.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know that the tide of immigration turned to this country
in the last century. Irish people haven’t always been immigrants.
Nine hundred years before Columbus set sail from Palos, Spain, a
bishop of the old faith named Brendan left his home in Galway,
sailed over the sea, visited Iceland and Greenland, and there are
today evidences of this man’s presence in Delaware and Virginia—nine
hundred years before Columbus set foot on this continent. Even
in the very crew which made up the contingent in Columbus’ navy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>which manned the three ships there was one to whom, when Columbus
left, he gave the custody of one of those ships, and this man’s
record proves he was an Irishman, William Ayer of Galway. We
have historical facts; they cannot be gainsaid; they stand out in bas-relief
today; the story is plain and intelligent men accept it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Immigration! Do you know that as the years have gone by they
have witnessed immigration from many lands? Germany has furnished
us with some of the best bone and sinew of its country. England,
through her unwise laws, through her erring principles of justice,
exacted from the Irish people something that they would not
give—taxation without representation, and surrender of civic and religious
liberty. Deprived of everything that men in common hold
dear, deprived of education, of religious worship, they were driven
from the shores of Ireland and found the arms of Columbia extended
and ready to receive them as children. We came here, and we thank
England for sending us here. If it hadn’t been for the conditions
of a hundred and fifty years ago, we might be toiling there today. It
is a wise Providence that directs and overrules conditions. We came,
and this asylum was beautiful, the flag of freedom and union waved
for us, everything was lovely compared with what we had left behind.
Friends and kindred, religion and society grew up within our own experiences.
The warm heart of the Irishman broadened; he grew,
and when the country rang out the alarm, when the country announced
that it was menaced with danger, in that Irish boy’s ears
rang the traditions and the wrongs of ages. He buckled on his
belt; he took down the flintlock from the wall; he marched forward
anywhere, everywhere, under the command of Washington and Sullivan,—Washington,
the ideal, and Sullivan, the son of an Irish
exile. These were the traits exhibited.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Theirs not to reason why—not to make reply—but to do and
die.’ These men made it possible for you and for me to live to enjoy
the conditions of today, to be here in this temple of local pride.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am reminded of the story so beautifully told in Roman history
of the mother who once paid a visit to a wealthy matron of that glorious
republic so many centuries ago. After dinner the matron said,
‘Now I must show you my beautiful jewels.’ They were carefully
guarded, but she displayed them to the eyes of her visitor, and then
remarked, ‘You must show me your jewels when I go to your house.’
In turn she called upon the mother, and stayed a little longer than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>is usual, awaiting the exhibition of jewels. Finally she inquired,
‘Have you forgotten to show me your jewels?’ ‘Oh, no,’ the mother
replied. ‘Come this way,’ and as she threw open a door five beautiful
children were revealed. ‘These,’ she exclaimed, ‘are my jewels.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“People of Rhode Island, these noble patriots and these scarred
flags are your sacred jewels. Guard their memory, defend it, and,
as your blood has the rich central vein of patriotism, so sacrifice all
you have to keep these jewels sacredly enshrined in your hearts forever.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I would that Sullivan could get a day’s leave from his sacred
parole. I would that he could come back to us today, that he might
obtain from the St. Gabriel of St. Peter’s Gate a day’s leave of absence
to look at these pillars and to gaze about these corridors. We
almost hear the whisper, can almost note the footfall of a strange
presence here. It is the spirit of the Revolutionary hero that communes
with us; it is the lofty emotion that emanates from him,
though unseen, and which commends our spirit of patriotism and ratifies
our act, not to him individually but to the noble band of which
he was Captain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is a great day for Rhode Island. This is a great day for
America, because this afternoon and tomorrow the wave of thought
that is ours will extend beyond us and be carried everywhere to receptive
minds. The sunlight will dash it into every possible nook
and corner of the land; the rivers will take it down to the Mexican
slope; the whole country will vibrate with it. You who know the
history of the man we honor, cherish it in your memory, and when
you recall these exercises, congratulate yourself that in assisting at
them you have fulfilled a duty; one and all, you have paid the homage
of a great and noble State.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One moment more, my friends. I have tarried long. This page
stands out alone in the history of this Society of which I have the
honor and rare privilege of being the Executive. Ladies and gentlemen,
that Society has one purpose; that purpose is written between
the lines of today’s event. We want to know the men who have
lived, who have fought, who have bled, who have given everything
to the cause of the American people. We want to record their deeds
in order that the womb of the future may bring forth a race, generations
distant from us, that will stand up and say, ‘I, too, am
Irish, although I have six generations separating me from that blood,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>a race that will cherish everything Irish and will extend the open
hand of welcome to everyone who bears the hall mark of Ireland,
whether his religion be Catholic or Protestant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are broad, we are honest, we are liberal. We want to attack
no man, but when we peruse the pages of American history, when we
turn over volume after volume, chapter after chapter, page after
page, and search paragraph after paragraph, line after line, syllable
after syllable, and see no recognition of the services of Irishmen, our
hearts bleed because the omission is culpable and not due to the fact
that the historian could find no achievements to make good his lines.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We claim our place in this Republic. We have sacrificed everything
in the world for it. We would go further tomorrow and pledge
every security, sever ourselves from home, to protect our freedom and
these flags. The United States is ours, whether on the shores of California,
Maine, Texas, or Washington. There is one freedom, one
brotherhood of man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I could detain you longer, friends, but the time allotted me forbids.
I have lingered longer than I should, but I know of no sentiment
with which I might more fittingly conclude than that of one
of your great New England worthies, the man who is enshrined in
the sanctuary of your hearts, John Boyle O’Reilly. He says, in his
own peculiar but grand way:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘No treason we bring from Erin, nor bring we shame nor guilt!</div>
      <div class='line'>The sword we hold may be broken, but we have not dropped the hilt.</div>
      <div class='line'>The wreath we bear to Columbia is twisted to thorns, not bays;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the songs we sing are saddened by thoughts of desolate days.</div>
      <div class='line'>But the hearts we bring for freedom are washed in the surge of tears;</div>
      <div class='line'>And we claim our right by a people’s fight outliving a thousand years.’”</div>
    </div>

</div>

<p class='c007'>At the termination of the exercises at the State House the Society
and its guests proceeded to the Narragansett Hotel for luncheon.
Chairman Lee acted as toastmaster, and speeches of an appropriate
nature were made by the following: Gen. Charles R. Brayton, representing
the National Encampment, G. A. R.; Hon. John F. O’Connell;

  <h2 class='c004'>RECORDS OF THE ANNUAL MEETING AND BANQUET OF THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY AT WASHINGTON, D. C., JANUARY 16, 1909, AND OF THE RECEPTION TO THE SOCIETY BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It having been voted at the annual meeting at New York January
29, 1908, to hold the next annual meeting at Washington,
D. C.; the Executive Council at a well-attended meeting thereof held
at the residence of the President-General, December 5, 1908, considered
the necessary arrangements, and resolved to make this event a
notable one in the Society’s history. A committee previously appointed
by the President-General to confer with Hon. Theodore
Roosevelt, President of the United States, and ascertain his pleasure
as to a reception to the Society and attendance later at the dinner,
reported that owing to pressure of official business President
Roosevelt would be unable to attend the Society’s dinner, but would
be pleased to meet his fellow-members at the White House and
there make a short address.</p>

<p class='c008'>In accordance with the instruction of the Executive Council the
Secretary-General opened correspondence with Mr. William Loeb,
Jr., Secretary to President Roosevelt, and the details of the reception
were promptly arranged.</p>

<p class='c008'>President-General Quinlan thereupon appointed a Reception Committee
to officiate at the White House and afterwards be on duty at
the Society’s headquarters in Washington, and a Dinner Committee
to arrange all the details of the annual banquet.</p>

<p class='c008'>The appointees on these committees appear in the circular letter
which follows.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dinner Committee carefully looked over the available places
in Washington suitable for the annual banquet, and decided upon
the Hotel Raleigh as most desirable, not only for this purpose but
also for the headquarters of the Society.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Thomas J. Talty, the manager of the Hotel Raleigh, extended
the Committee every courtesy and made their work in the Society’s
behalf easy and pleasant.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>As soon as all necessary details were completed, the following circular

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Program for Annual Meeting, Reception to the Society by the President
of the United States, and Annual Banquet at Washington,
D. C., January 16, 1909.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>Our fellow-member, Hon. Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United
States, will receive the Society at the White House at 2.30 p. m. Secretary
Loeb requests us to be on time and provide each member with a card of
identification. Such a card is enclosed and must be presented to the doorkeeper
at the White House. Ladies and guests may accompany members, and
tickets for them can be obtained from the Acting Secretary-General upon application
of any member by mail or on the day of the Reception.</p>

<p class='c013'>Members whose convenience will permit will leave New York Saturday
morning, January 16, 1909, from West 23d Street station at 7.50 a. m., or
from Liberty Street station at 8 a. m., to take the Royal Blue Line train
leaving Jersey City at 8.12 a. m., arriving in Washington at 1.12 p. m. Reduced
round trip rates have been arranged for on this line, a dining-car will
be attached for our comfort and convenience, and this is the only train landing
us in Washington in time to get to our quarters at the hotel and be in season
for the President’s Reception.</p>

<p class='c013'>Immediately after the President’s Reception, the annual meeting of the Society
will be held in the parlors of the Hotel Raleigh, where the Society’s
headquarters will be established, for the election of officers for the ensuing
year, the receiving and acting upon resolutions on the death of several prominent
members of the Society, including our deeply-lamented Secretary-General,
and the transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting.
The resolutions and eulogies to be offered are of a high order.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the termination of the business meeting, opportunity will be given to
visit the capitol, Congressional Library, public buildings, historical societies,
and other points of interest in Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tickets for the dinner are $5.00 each and may be obtained from the Acting
Secretary-General, whose address is below. It is very important that we
know exactly how many members are to be present, and you are earnestly requested
to send your remittance for tickets promptly so that we may notify Mr.
Talty of the Hotel Raleigh how many he may expect. Members may invite
guests at the same price per ticket.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Reception to the members of the Society by its officers will take place in
the parlors of the Hotel Raleigh at 6.30 p. m., and this will be an excellent
opportunity for exchange of good fellowship with the new members, nearly one
hundred and fifty of whom have been elected during the past year. The Reception
Committee, consisting of Michael W. Norton, Esq., of Rhode Island,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Hon. John D. Crimmins of New York, Hon. Joseph Geoghegan of Utah,
Patrick F. Magrath, Esq., of New York, Hon. John F. O’Connell of Rhode

Eustace of New York, Hon. Thomas J. Lynch of Maine, Gen. John R. McGinness
of Virginia, and Hon. Thomas M. Waller of Connecticut, will be in
attendance during the day to do everything possible to make it a pleasant occasion
for the members.</p>

<p class='c013'>At seven o’clock the annual dinner will take place. It will be in charge of
the Dinner Committee, consisting of Hon. Edward A. Moseley, chairman;
Rear Admiral John McGowan, these two former Presidents-General of the
Society; Michael F. Dooley, Esq., Treasurer-General; Hon. Lawrence O. Murray
and Patrick J. Haltigan, Esq.</p>

<p class='c013'>An elaborate menu, excellent music and extensive floral decorations have
been provided, and the principal speakers at the post-prandial exercises and
their toasts will be as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“A Capitol Welcome,” Hon. Thomas H. Carter, U. S. Senator from Montana.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Irish Pioneers of New York,” Hon. Victor J. Dowling, Justice of the
Supreme Court of the State of New York.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Irish Pioneers of the West and Their Descendants,” Hon. Maurice T.
Moloney, ex-Attorney General of Illinois.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Advantages of Historical Research to Irish Americans,” Hon. Robert J.
Gamble, United States Senator from South Dakota.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other addresses will follow if time permits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our list of guests is headed by Hon. Edward D. White of Louisiana, Justice
of the Supreme Court of the United States, and will include many notable
men.</p>

<p class='c008'>Please send in your replies as early as possible. The seats at the table will
be allotted members and guests in the order in which the applications are
received. The officers of the Society earnestly request the attendance of every
member who can make it possible to come, because it is desired to make an
excellent showing in Washington and thus bring the Society and its work more
successfully to the attention of all the people in the country interested in
making “better known the Irish Chapter in American history.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The responses came in so well that the Society felt warranted
in ordering a special train for the comfortable transportation of
members and guests to Washington, and through our fellow-member,
Mr. Henry L. Joyce, the Royal Blue Line provided a train
of six Pullman parlor-cars, a dining-car and a baggage-car for our
exclusive use, and so notified the Society.</p>

<p class='c008'>Further notice was then sent to the members as follows:</p>

Street station, at 7.50 a. m. If 100 members are on hand, a special train will
be put in commission and start ten minutes later from the same place. Fares

<p class='c013'>We want at least 250 members at Washington. Ladies, accompanied by

<p class='c007'>A large party of members and guests availed themselves of the
pleasure of the special train, and our comfort was well cared for
by Mr. Joyce, ably assisted by Mr. P. Wilfred Heroy, Eastern Passenger
Agent of the Central Railroad of New Jersey, and a picked
train crew.</p>

<p class='c008'>Owing to a severe snowstorm encountered <em>en route</em>, it became evident
the special would not reach Washington on scheduled time,
and a telegram to Secretary Loeb was sent from Baltimore as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Special train of American Irish Historical Society unavoidably
delayed <em>en route</em>. Regret inability to reach White House before
two forty-five.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In order that no time should be lost, orders were given the train
crew to take the baggage of each passenger to the Hotel Raleigh,
there to be cared for until our return from the White House.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following copy of the order given by C. H. English, Passenger
Trainmaster of the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey,

<p class='c007'>The Dinner Committee was on hand to meet the train and special
street cars were in readiness to take us to the Reception.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nearly 300 members and guests were in attendance at the White
House when President Roosevelt made his appearance, accompanied
by his military attendants. He was in excellent spirits and
pleased to see so large a representation of the Society in Washington.</p>

<p class='c008'>In introducing President Roosevelt to the assemblage, President-General
Quinlan said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ladies and Gentlemen, I am especially honored today in presenting
to you the gifted ruler of our great nation, one who at all times
has shown true sympathy with our cause and who has recorded his
feeling by associating himself with our Society. It is with feelings
of mingled pride and satisfaction that I introduce to you our fellow-member,
Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States.”</p>

<p class='c007'>President Roosevelt replied as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is a great pleasure to me to bid you welcome to Washington,
and especially to have the chance of saying a word of greeting to you
here in the White House. I am sorry we didn’t give you a little
better weather, and I especially regret that, in view of the fact that
so many of you have had the wisdom to bring your better halves with
you; for I have always insisted that, while the average American
citizen is a pretty good fellow, his wife is a still better fellow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I need scarcely say the great interest that I take in the work of
this body. Here on this continent we are building up a great new
nation, a nation akin to, but different from, each of the Old World
nations of middle and western Europe. To this country have come
men of many different origins, and here they are being fused together
into a new type, and it is greatly to be desired that we should have
historical associations like this which shall commemorate the different
strains in the national blood.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is a mistake to suppose, as is so often assumed, that at the
time of the Revolution our people were not of mixed blood. They
were then, just as they are now. Many different strains from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>beginning contributed to make up what is now American citizenship,
and from the beginning in this country the men who themselves,
or whose fathers, came from Ireland have played a great and
leading part in the affairs of the nation. I myself have some of
that blood in me, and doubtless this accounts for the difficulties with
which I have found myself confronted at times. It may also account
for my disposition after getting into a fight to let the other fellow
know I was in it. I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for coming
here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was great applause and much enthusiasm upon the well-chosen
words, and afterwards the assemblage formed in line and
each person was presented to President Roosevelt by President-General
Quinlan and Hon. Edward A. Moseley, Michael F. Dooley,
Esq., Hon. Lawrence O. Murray and Patrick J. Haltigan, Esq., of
the Dinner Committee.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the termination of the Reception the party went to the Hotel
Raleigh for the annual meeting.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ANNUAL MEETING.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The annual meeting of the Society was held this 16th day of
January, 1909, in the banquet hall of the Hotel Raleigh, and was
called to order at 3.30 p. m. by President-General Quinlan, a large
number of members being present.</p>

<p class='c008'>Reading of records of the previous meeting was omitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first business being the election of officers for the ensuing
year, the Secretary-General read the following list of nominees selected
by the Executive Council to be voted upon at this meeting.
Each of the general officers were voted upon separately, and the
members of the Executive Council and list of State Vice-Presidents
as a whole, and all were unanimously elected to serve until the next
annual meeting and until others are chosen in their stead.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Nothing could have given me greater pleasure than to be able to attend
the annual meeting and reception to the American Irish Historical Society
by President Roosevelt on Saturday evening, the 16th inst. Unfortunately, I
am so tied up with engagements on that evening that it will be impossible for
me to leave here, one being a dinner engagement of long standing, which,
however, I might be able to break; but, in addition, I am scheduled to speak
at the annual meeting and banquet of the field force of the Metropolitan
Life Insurance Company, of which, as you know, I am a director, and which
is to be held at Delmonico’s. This arrangement was made prior to the time
when the date of the reception to your Society was fixed, and it is incumbent
upon me to be present, and while I fully intended going to Washington
and attending the reception, and so expressed myself to Judge Dowling, who,
I understand, is to deliver an address, yet I now realize the impracticability
of being in two places at the same time, and will therefore have to forego
the pleasure of being there.</p>

<p class='c013'>I trust you will appreciate my position, and I assure you that ordinarily I
would be only too glad to break any engagement I might have and avail
myself of the pleasure of being present on such an occasion, but in reaching
a decision I could not do otherwise than give way in favor of the engagement
which was prior in point of time.</p>

<p class='c013'>I deeply appreciate your kind expressions, and the more than attractive
manner in which you urge me to be present, all of which would be unnecessary
in any matter in which you were concerned, because the mere expression
of your wish that you desired my co-operation in any of the good works in
which you are interested would always receive from me a prompt response.</p>

<p class='c013'>With kind regards personally, believe me to be,</p>

<p class='c013'><em>My dear Sir</em>: The Mayor has been sick since Friday of last week, and although
he is now out of bed the doctor positively forbids him to make a trip
to Washington. He sent a message to me requesting me to notify you of
this fact and to express to you his deep regret. I know he was looking forward
with very pleasant anticipation to this trip and to his meeting with you
again.</p>

<p class='c013'>I find in the mail two tickets to the banquet and not appreciating the
situation fully I am enclosing them to you, thinking that you may be able to
make some use of them as long as the Mayor can not go, but if these are
sent out and charged to the persons to whom they are sent, you will please
advise the Mayor and he will send you the cost of the same.</p>

dilate with feelings to this night’s occasion, and what a host of interesting
recollections spring up in the mind when we reflect upon the time when Irishmen
came to the shores of this country in the spirit of holy zeal, leaving the
land of their birth, braving the winds of Heaven and the angry wrath of the
mighty Atlantic, landing in the wilderness and planting the seeds of a holy
religion as well as laying the foundation of the mighty and greatest of all

<p class='c007'>Mr. Patrick M. Keating presented and read the following memorial
to the late Hon. Thomas J. Gargan, former President-General
of the Society, which was adopted by unanimous vote:</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Memorial of Thomas J. Gargan.</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>“The members of the American Irish Historical Society by this
memorial desire to pay a tribute of love and respect to the memory
of their late associate and President-General, Thomas J. Gargan,
and to express their appreciation of his character and ability and
their recognition of the great loss the Society has sustained in his
death.</p>

<p class='c013'>“His parents were among the pioneer Irish emigrants who came
to this country in the early part of the nineteenth century and
settled in Boston, where he was born about sixty-six years ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In early life he was engaged in mercantile pursuits, but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>practice of law strongly attracted him and he was admitted to the
bar in the year 1875. As a lawyer he was not merely a successful
practitioner, but an ornament to the profession, scorning to descend
to dishonorable tactics or to adopt the acts of a pettifogger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He filled various positions of honor and responsibility, both public
and private, faithfully and efficiently. He took an active part
in causes that brought into requisition the zeal, sympathy and interest
of worthy citizens and rendered valuable service to his city, state and
country. Whether it was a call for patriotic service for the preservation
of the republic or an invitation to join his fellow citizens
in aiding a people struggling for liberty, or in providing relief for
those who were afflicted by reason of some extraordinary catastrophe—on
all such occasions he responded cheerfully and contributed his
full share by word and by deed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“While he rendered conspicuous public service as an American
citizen he was ever mindful of the land of his forefathers, and of
the race from which he sprung. In early manhood he became the
president of the Charitable Irish Society of Boston, which is one
of the oldest societies in this country, having been established in the
year 1737, and from the time the American Irish Historical Society
was organized he was interested in its welfare, and was honored
about ten years ago by being elected to the highest office within the
gift of its members.</p>

<p class='c013'>“His eloquence, copiousness of ideas and fluency of speech made
his orations edifying and instructive, and his voice, so rich and tender
and with depth of feeling, made the public addresses delivered
by him in memory of the late Mayor Collins and other distinguished
men, models of eulogistic oratory.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But he was esteemed most highly by the members of this Society
as a true and kind friend, whose sunny temperament, sparkling wit,
genial humor and upright character won their love and admiration
and will long keep him alive in their memories.”</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Resolved</em>, That this memorial be entered upon the records of
this Society and that a copy thereof be sent to the widow of our late
fellow-member together with the assurance of the deep respect and
affection in which he was held by us and the expression of our heartfelt
sympathy in her sorrow and bereavement.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Keating’s eulogy followed the memorial and was an eloquent
tribute to our late President-General.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Mr. Gargan was born at Boston, Mass., October 27, 1844, and
died at Berlin, Germany, July 31, 1908.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following memorial to the late Mr. James J. Phelan was
presented and read by Mr. Edward J. McGuire, and it was unanimously
voted that the same be adopted and that a copy thereof be
sent to the family of Mr. Phelan:</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Memorial of James J. Phelan.</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>“James J. Phelan died at his country home at Allenhurst, New
Jersey, on August 3, 1908, in the sixty-first year of his age. He was
a native of the city of New York.</p>

<p class='c013'>“His father was of Irish birth. His mother was a native of
Maryland. His father, John Phelan, came to New York in his
early youth with his father. They settled in Greenwich Village,
afterwards known as the “Old Ninth Ward,” early in the nineteenth
century, and established a successful business in the grocery trade.
John Phelan was a man of shrewdness and commercial ability, which
qualities he transmitted to his son. He was one of the Phelan family
that distinguished itself in the commerce of San Francisco in the
pioneer days and still maintains its high reputation there. John
Phelan largely increased his fortune by his relations to the trade
with California in the decade between 1850 and 1860.</p>

<p class='c013'>“James J. Phelan attended first the public schools and then the
commercial department of the College of St. Francis Xavier, of
which famous institution he remained a steadfast friend ever afterwards.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In 1867, his father, intending him for a business career, established
him as the proprietor of a general store at Fordham, which
was then a village in Westchester County but which now forms one
of the important centers in the borough of the Bronx, New York
City. He spent the formative years of his business life in the conduct
of this venture.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In 1870, at the age of twenty-five, he formed the firm of Phelan
and Duval, which engaged in the wholesale wine and spirits trade
and became one of the important houses in its department. He continued
in active management of the affairs of this business until the
year 1883, when he took charge of even larger interests.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The American Contracting and Dredging Company was formed
about that time among other things for construction work upon
the Panama canal under the French concessionaries. It controlled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>valuable patent rights in dredging machinery. It secured several
important contracts from Count Ferdinand de Lesseps as president
of the French company and afterwards constructed fifteen
miles of the Panama canal. It was most successful financially
and its careful management avoided serious complications with the
misfortunes of the Frenchmen. When its contracts were completed
it withdrew from the field. Mr. Phelan was one of the
master minds in this great work. Among his associates were Eugene
Kelly, Charles N. Fry and George Bliss of distinguished and
honorable memory in American finance, and Commander Gorringe
of the United States Navy, who will be remembered for his engineering
success in transporting the obelisk from Egypt to Central
Park and setting it in its place without a single mishap.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This, however, was but one of the important enterprises carried
on by Mr. Phelan with success. His ability in commercial and
corporate affairs was rare and as his remarkable grasp of great
affairs and his skill in their administration became known he was
invited into enterprises of the most important and lucrative character.
He achieved from them a large fortune as well as a high
reputation in finance. He died a member of the Chamber of
Commerce of the City of New York.</p>

<p class='c013'>“His active business life did not absorb all his energies. He
was a man who from his youth took active part in the political
life of the city. He joined also the societies working in the field
of religion and morality. He was fond of his friends and of social
life. He was always faithful to the traditions of the old Irish
race from which he was descended and active in its cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In 1890 he became a commissioner of the Dock Department of
the City of New York on the appointment of Mayor Hugh J.
Grant. He left upon that office the impress of his ability in one
of the most important divisions of the affairs of the world’s greatest
seaport, at a time when millions of dollars were available and
were spent in providing for the oceanic trade of the port of New
York. His service lasted four years, when he resigned with the
praise and good wishes of the entire municipality.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He was identified almost from his youth with the work of the
Xavier Alumni Sodality, of the Catholic Club and of the St. Vincent
de Paul Society. He rendered each of them great service,
both as an officer and as a member. He was a trustee of the
Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum, of the Catholic Benevolent Legion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>of the Catholic Summer School and of many other philanthropic
societies. He was a member of many of them in their
struggling years and he gave his powers and his industry in full
measure to their proper development.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He was a member of the American Irish Historical Society
from its establishment. He was always most interested in its work
and devoted to the cause for which it stood. His pleasant face
will be missed from its gatherings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He was married twice, the second time in 1881 to Marie Foran
of New York. He had four sons and four daughters, who with
his widow survive him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“James J. Phelan was an example of the truth that in proper
conditions the men of the Irish race surely rise to eminence in
fields in which the current prejudice and error of the age deny
that excellence is possible to them. From small beginnings and
in conflict with adverse circumstances he rose to great fortune and
conspicuous position in the metropolis by the exercise of thrift,
temperance, honesty and intelligence. He met all sorts and conditions
of men and asking no favor he conquered success, holding
fast at the same time to the ideals of the race from which he sprung
and the ancient faith to which he was ever loyal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The following memorial to the late Thomas Hamilton Murray,
former Secretary-General of the Society, was presented and read
by the present Secretary-General, Mr. Thomas Z. Lee, and it was
unanimously voted that the same be adopted and that a copy
thereof be sent to the widow of Mr. Murray:</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Memorial of Thomas Hamilton Murray.</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>“On June 5, 1908, Thomas Hamilton Murray, editor, genealogist
and historian, died at his home in Sea View in the town of
Marshfield, Massachusetts, in the fifty-first year of his age.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He was one of the founders of the American Irish Historical
Society and its Secretary-General from the date of its organization
until his death. During his administration the Society grew in
numbers and influence, pursuing its good work and historical researches
into most of the states of the Union, until he saw it occupying
the foremost place in this country of any organization engaged
in similar work. He was proud of the Society and gave it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>his best efforts. To him every individual member was personally
known, and he took pride in stimulating each with a sense of the
responsibility undertaken in making better known the Irish chapter
in American history.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Murray obtained his early education in the public schools
of Newton, Cambridge and Boston, Mass., and, when he reached
his majority, chose journalism as his profession. He was a close
observer, a ready writer and possessed a style direct and attractive.
The seven volumes of the <span class='sc'>Journal</span> edited by him bear eloquent
testimony to his literary ability. For a while he contributed educational,
literary and historical articles to the <cite>Boston Pilot</cite> and enjoyed
the coöperation and friendship of its then editor, John Boyle
O’Reilly; later he became a member of the staff of the <cite>Boston Globe</cite>,
where he remained several years. Ben Palmer was editor of the
<cite>Globe</cite> at that time, and the <cite>Globe</cite> office was one of the best schools
of journalism in the country. With a well-regulated mind and a
strong constitution, Mr. Murray worked hard and the training
there obtained well fitted him for the life work he had undertaken
and the filling of important positions to which he was later called.</p>

<p class='c013'>“After leaving the <cite>Globe</cite>, Mr. Murray became court reporter for
the <cite>Boston Daily Star</cite>, then editor of the <cite>Roxbury Advocate</cite>, and
afterwards editor of the <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite>, a morning paper at Shelton,
Conn. He next became night editor of the <cite>Morning News</cite>, of
Bridgeport, Conn., but soon returned to day work and became editor
of the <cite>Daily Record</cite> at Meriden, Conn., where he remained until
called to the editorial chair of the <cite>Evening and Sunday Telegram</cite>
at Providence, R. I. After five years in this position, he became
editor of the <cite>Lawrence Daily Sun</cite>, and four years later took charge
of the <cite>Evening Call</cite> at Woonsocket.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He had long taken a deep interest in historical studies, particularly
in relation to the events and epochs of persons of Irish
extraction, and his lectures and writings showed not only his devotion
to his subjects, but a wide range of learning and research
as well as a high order of literary ability. In addition to his invaluable
work for this Society he was the author of many historical
works, some of which are as follows:</p>

faithful. No call for service came to him in its behalf to which
he did not respond. The highest office in the Society he might
have had and political preferment could have been his from the
appreciative citizens of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, but he
turned from them lest his time and efforts might be diverted from
that branch of history he loved so well. As long as his strength
held out, he was in the harness serving the Society and, at our last
annual meeting in New York, unable to walk, he was carried from
the Grand Central Depot to the Manhattan Hotel, and there he
conducted to the end the magnificent dinner and entertainment that
followed the meeting. The effort was almost fatal, and during
the night loving and tender friends watched over him but, by determined
will, he rallied and reached his pretty villa at Sea View
from which he never departed again in life. In all his work for
the Society, he was ably assisted by his noble wife, Mary H. Sullivan
Murray, a lady of great intelligence and refinement, who took
up the work of the Secretary-General and faithfully maintained it
until a member could be selected to relieve her. In paying our
deep tribute to her husband, it would be amiss not to mention the
faithful wife and assistant who now mourns with us his loss.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We wish to record here the great benefits which we have received
from the work and services of our first Secretary-General
and pay tribute to his learning and ability; we further record the
deep sorrow with which we look upon his vacant place, and, lastly,
we record our loving tribute of affection for Thomas Hamilton
Murray as a man, fearless, honest and faithful, an upright citizen
and an earnest member of the Society.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Dear Mrs. Murray</em>: I am very sorry to learn of the death of Mr. Murray.
I did not hear of it till it was too late for me to attend the funeral to
show the respect and esteem I have felt for him from the first time I
met him, several years before the American Irish Historical Society was organized.
From that time to this our relations were most cordial and my most
sincere sympathy is extended to yourself and your family for the great loss
you have sustained. It is a great loss. You and your family have not alone
felt this loss, but everyone who had or has any interest in American Irish
history must also recognize it. It will be hard to get a man to fill his
place in this latter capacity. Again let me express my sincere sympathy with
you in your bereavement.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let me thank you for the return of the pictures that I received last Saturday.
I was thinking, before their receipt, where I would send a letter addressed
to you expressive of my sympathy at your loss but could not make up
my mind where to send it. I saw the Sea View postmark on the envelope
over the pictures and I send this to that address.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following memorial to the late Major John Crane, prepared
by Hon. Eugene A. Philbin, was also unanimously adopted, and it
was voted to send a copy thereof to the family of Major Crane:</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Memorial of John Crane.</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>“It very rarely happens that it is given to a man to be a source
of inspiration to his fellowmen in more than one phase of human
effort. A man may, during his life, have given evidence of exalted
and self-denying patriotism, or have been conspicuous in the great
field of charity, or an example of the highest type of the successful
and upright business man, or a great leader in movements for the
uplifting of mankind, but the average man cannot hope to establish
a claim for recognition for more than one of these achievements.
John Crane, however, was entitled to credit for a distinguished
career in all. He was born in Morgan County, Ohio, on
the 10th day of February, 1840. His mother died while he was
quite young and his father took the family to the State of Wisconsin.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>War was declared between the North and South when he
had hardly attained manhood, but, with two other young men, he
organized a company of volunteers and was elected first lieutenant.
This company offered its services to the governor of the State and
was assigned to the Sixth Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry. The
regiment was ordered to the Army of the Potomac, and was incorporated
with other regiments which were known as the “Iron
Brigade,” and as such attained great distinction for noteworthy
services during the war. Mr. Crane served with the Sixth Wisconsin
until the winter of 1862, when he resigned, but only for
the purpose of aiding in the organization of the Seventeenth Wisconsin
Volunteer Infantry, an Irish regiment which was being raised
in that State. He was successful in organizing Company A, and
became its first lieutenant. This regiment in March, 1862, was ordered
South, and their first stop was at St. Louis, whence they went
to Tennessee, arriving at Pittsburgh Landing, Tennessee, a couple
of days after the Battle of Shiloh. The regiment was assigned to
the division of General McArthur, with whom it served during the
campaign, taking part in numerous skirmishes and the Battle of
Corinth. About this time the Adjutant of the regiment resigned
and Lieutenant Crane was appointed Adjutant, which position he
held until the close of the war. Upon the organization of the Seventeenth
Army Corps, Gen. J. B. McPherson commanding (afterwards
killed before Atlanta), the regiment became one of the regiments
of this Corps, taking part in the campaign before the Siege of
Vicksburg. They participated in the siege, and the regiment,
Lieut.-Col. Thomas MacMahon commanding, joined with others in
making the first assault on the breastworks at Vicksburg, May 19,
1863. The regimental officers and men were most highly commended
by their commanding officer. John Crane bore a distinguished
part in this assault and was personally complimented by
the general commanding. The Seventeenth Corps was part of the
Army of the Tennessee under General Sherman and served in all
its campaign before Atlanta and on the march to the sea. Notwithstanding
the fact that John Crane was of a naturally impulsive
nature, during the battle his ability to command and exercise
a considerate supervision of his men was never affected. His
bravery was characterized by unfaltering fearlessness, but never
marred by recklessness. He remained in the service until the war
was concluded.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“In the year 1868 Mr. Crane engaged in business with Colonel
MacMahon, to whom reference has been made. Later William A.
MacMahon, who served in the same regiment, entered the business,
which was conducted under the name of Crane &#38; MacMahon at the
time of Mr. Crane’s death, which occurred on April 8, 1908, in
New York City. The tie that had been formed with the MacMahon
brothers in the service was strengthened by Mr. Crane’s
marriage to their sister in the year 1866. She still survives him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“From the outset, even when his time was much taken in forming
his business relations and organizing his affairs, he was deeply and
practically interested in charity. He commenced then the practice
which was continued to the end of his life, not only of giving
most liberally, but also of devoting his time and personal attention to
the relief of the poor. For many years he was chairman of the
finance committee of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and it was
largely due to his gentle but firm persistency that persons able to do
so were made to contribute. It was rarely that a meeting of the committee
was held that there was not some practical suggestion by him
towards procuring those already interested to take a still greater interest
or to secure the sympathy of people who had not already
contributed in the great work. His effort in this important field
was never limited to satisfying the physical suffering of the moment,
but included a practical and effective course, having for its end not
only the provision for pecuniary resources, but the inspiration of
new courage and hope. The battle always became easier and the
prospect more hopeful after a visit from John Crane.</p>

      <div class='line'>“Careless their merits or their faults to scan,</div>
      <div class='line'>His pity gave ere charity began.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Since he carried into business the great elements of character
that had made him a distinguished and able soldier and was constantly
inspired by the broad spirit of charity which engendered
the desire for fair dealing, it was only natural that his efforts
should meet with success and that he and his associate should attain
a position in the business world distinguished for an honorable
policy and ability to produce effective results.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The reward which attended his efforts in the great spheres of
life, to which reference has already been made, caused a deeper appreciation
of the value of spiritual inspiration. He realized that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>the battles that he had fought on the field of war and in civic life
had been won because of his reliance not upon man or things, but
upon the Supreme Being. He took advantage of every opportunity
to convey this great lesson to his fellowmen. When about ten
years before his death Governor Roosevelt appointed him a member
of the board of trustees of the Soldiers’ Home in Steuben County,
New York state, he was given an opportunity that probably brought
him more real gratification than any other one thing in his philanthropic
career. He organized at the Soldiers’ Home religious
societies which furnished spiritual gratification to the veteran soldiers,
and also gave them a new occupation that tended to relieve
the monotony of institutional life. It seemed to him as if he were
again, after the lapse of so many years, participating with pathetic
care and solicitation in the careers and welfare of those who,
under his guidance, were giving their lives to their country. It is
not difficult to imagine what this opportunity meant to Major Crane.
It is needless to say that the duty was discharged, not only in a
manner that gave happiness to the inmates at the time, but also
inaugurated methods that were so meritorious as to remain permanently
to the advantage of the Home.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Major Crane never entered actively into politics, although he
was a man of clear and positive views as to public welfare. From
time to time he freely lent his voice and aid to movements having
for their object civic betterment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He was for many years the almoner of the Friendly Sons of
St. Patrick, and gave the same intelligent and able consideration to
the appeals made to the Society by the unfortunate as he had given
to many other cases of distress. He was a most active and faithful
member of the latter society, and, in fact, was deeply interested in
anything that concerned the Irish race and furnished evidence of
the great benefits it had conferred upon mankind.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Major Crane was especially interested in American-Irish history
because of its eloquent testimony in support of Irish virtue and ability.
His own noble record will always be a bright page in the
annals of the race in this country.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Memorial of Hon. Hugh Kelly.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In the death of Hugh Kelly, President of the corporation of
Hugh Kelly &#38; Co., 79 Wall Street, New York City, the downtown
business community of New York lost a man of sound judgment of
men and affairs, and a true friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Kelly was born in Chicago, September 24th, 1858, and when
a year old came to New York, where he lived thereafter. He was
graduated from the College of the City of New York with high
honors and was later honored with the degrees of Master of Arts
and Doctors of Laws by Fordham University. In 1871 he entered
the West Indian trade and in 1884 established the house
of Hugh Kelly &#38; Co., which is well-known throughout the cane
sugar world. He was very successful in designing and constructing
several of the largest and most modern sugar cane factories in
Cuba, Porto Rico and Santo Domingo, and was one of the best
known merchants in that industry.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was president of several sugar companies in the West Indies,
but found time also to devote himself to maritime and municipal
affairs, and was in the directorate of the United Fruit Company, The
Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank, the Nipe Bay Company, and
other industrial enterprises. He was also a Trustee of St. Patrick’s
Cathedral, the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum, Calvary Cemetery,
the Sevilla Home for Children, and the Central Islip State Hospital.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Kelly served the city as a member of the Board of Education
from 1895 to 1898, and was Treasurer of its Finance Committee.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was Vice-President of the Maritime Exchange in 1894 and
1895, President in 1896 and 1897, and for seven years was on its directorate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Kelly was made president of The Oriental Bank in an effort
to save it shortly before it failed last Winter. He was a director
in the bank at the time of the financial depression, and when the
bank was threatened Mr. Kelly took up the task, two or three days
after his return from Europe, of realizing on the bank’s assets and
meeting the claims against it. He was going along very well when
fresh bank failures caused a run on the Oriental, which led to its
suspension. Attorney-General Jackson had receivers appointed but
they were soon removed by the Court. Full payment to every depositor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>was eventually made through an arrangement with the
Metropolitan Trust Company, which took over the Oriental Bank’s
assets. Mr. Kelly in his desire to keep the bank on its feet when
he accepted the presidency refused to accept a cent of remuneration,
his sole desire being to keep the bank going. The strain under
which he labored at that time, and the many false rumors which
those antagonistic to the bank had issued, preyed upon him greatly,
and an acute nervous ailment forced him to give up work three weeks
before his death, which occurred October 30th, 1908, at 3 a. m.</p>

<p class='c008'>The funeral was held at St. Patrick’s Cathedral on November
2d. Archbishop Farley celebrated solemn requiem mass. Some
of the other church dignitaries who assisted in the service were
Mgr. Lavelle, Mgr. Hayes, Father McCluskey and Father McQuade.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pall bearers were Joseph Rigney, Michael E. Bannin,
Thomas E. Murray, Col. John McAnerney, Richard S. Treacy,
James H. Post, President of the National Sugar Refining Company,
Joseph W. Foster, Frank Schaffer, Vice-President of Hugh Kelly &#38;
Co., Thomas Mulry, President Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank
and Myles Tierney, President of the Hudson Trust Company. The
interment was in Calvary Cemetery.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Kelly is survived by his widow, three sons and four daughters.</p>

<p class='c008'>Personally, Mr. Kelly was a quiet, hearty, genial man, easily
approachable and warm-hearted, seeming to have time for every
demand upon him in spite of his numerous responsibilities, and a
host of friends esteemed him most highly for his ability, integrity
and sound judgment. In the business life of New York in which
he moved, he will be deeply missed.</p>

was also unanimously adopted, and it was voted to send a copy

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>James Jeffrey Roche was born in the little Quaker town of Mountmellick in Queen’s County, Ireland, the son of Edward and Mary (Doyle) Roche and was taken while yet an infant of a few weeks, to Prince Edward’s Island, whither his parents emigrated. He grew up in Charlottetown, where his father Edward Roche, an accomplished scholar, conducted a school; and he supplemented the
training given him by his scholarly father by a course at the Jesuit
College of St. Dunstan’s in Charlottetown, from which he was graduated.
Among his college classmates were Chief Justice Sullivan
of Prince Edward’s Island and Archbishop O’Brien of Halifax,
N. S.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Roche settled in Boston in 1866 and was engaged in business
there for some years; but his peculiar gifts and tastes drew
him to journalism and letters; and in 1883 he became one of the
staff of the <cite>Pilot</cite>, under his brilliant friend John Boyle O’Reilly;
and after his death he succeeded to the post of editor-in-chief of
the paper which he filled with vigor and brilliancy, in full keeping
with the traditions of such predecessors as Thomas D’Arcy Magee,
O’Reilly and others. The <cite>Pilot</cite> was the avowed champion not
only of the Irish people and of their religion, but it stood ready
to do battle with persecution, injustice, intolerance and wrong,
no matter against what race or creed they were directed; and no
individual paper in the world did better or more effective work
for the men and cause of the Irish race; and under the management
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>of James Jeffrey Roche, zeal and fidelity to all good causes
were always fortified by sanity and justice and tempered by humor,
good temper and a fine inhospitality to passion and demagoguery.</p>

<p class='c008'>While devoting most of his time and talents to his editorial work
and duty, he still found opportunities to turn to the field of letters
of a more enduring character. A writer of virile and picturesque
prose, James Jeffrey Roche will always be best known as a poet
whose verse is marked by beauty, sweetness, lyrical quality and a
<i><span lang="fr">belle esprit</span></i> all his own, and ranging in scope from the light, brilliant
and witty <i><span lang="fr">vers de société</span></i> to such serious and compelling poems
as his “Babylon.” His “Songs and Satires” is a volume that sparkles
with wit and rapier-like touches. His “Ballads of Blue Water”
is a book for American men and patriots, unique and stirring; the
ballads will live while Americans look back with pride to the deeds
of an heroic past; and no American singer has written any better
ballads of action than “The Armstrong Privateer,” “The Constitution,”
“The Alamo” and other stirring songs. His “Life of
John Boyle O’Reilly” was the tribute of a devoted friend and admirer
to a man and comrade he loved and labored with, and is a
biography whose literary excellence is amazing when we consider
the pressure under which it was written. His other prose work
varied from the brilliant accuracy and gravity of “The Story of the
Filibusters” (republished by the Harpers as “The Byways of War”)
to those airy medleys of fun and philosophy “Her Majesty the
King” and “The Sorrows of Sap’ed,” which have made the world
laugh and think.</p>

<p class='c008'>A close personal friend and admirer of President Theodore
Roosevelt, he was appointed by him American Consul at Genoa,
Italy, in 1904, when his health being precarious, a change of work
and climate became necessary; and in 1907 the President transferred
him to the capital of Switzerland, Berne, where he lived until the
final call came to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>When in 1896 I broached to a few interested friends the project
of establishing an organization which would bring together men
of the Irish race interested in gathering and perpetuating the record
of the achievement of that race on this American continent,
and preserving it in such form that historians could utilize it and thus
ensure us our share of the honor and credit of upbuilding the American
Republic, I found him sympathetic and enthusiastic in the matter;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>and out of those gatherings and discussions sprang the movement
which resulted in the foundation of the American Irish Historical
Society. James Jeffrey Roche, John Linehan, Hamilton Murray
and I drew up the call, signed it, secured other signatures, called
a meeting at the Revere House, Boston, Mass., 20th January, 1897,
and the Society was born. He became one of the members of the
Executive Council and for many years we attended its meetings
and outings until conditions and circumstances stopped our attendance
without attenuating our interest in its progress.</p>

<p class='c008'>Personally, James Jeffrey Roche was one of the most lovable
and charming of men, who carried under a surface of wit and joyous
frivolity a nature whose depth, sincerity, devotion to ideals, capacity
for friendship, passion for freedom, love of race and motherland,
high-minded patriotism and loyalty to duty and honor, were understood
only by those who knew him intimately. He hated all meanness
and dishonor; friendship was a sacred thing to him; and he
had that clairvoyant vision of the poet which saw the humbug
and pharisee under the skin of the charlatan, when many a reputedly
wiser and more sophisticated man accepted the demagogue and
pretender at their own valuation.</p>

<p class='c008'>I knew him for many years; to me he was as my own flesh and
blood; I could not love a brother more; and his death was merely
the final chapter in the grief I experienced when he went from Boston
to represent the Republic abroad, in such physical condition
that I knew I would never look upon his face again in life; and I
know that in voicing my own sorrow I am but expressing the feelings
of those who were comrades in the past and lovers of him always.
He had reached the zenith of his literary powers before he
left the land of his adoption and love forever; and he himself
realized that his work was done, and that only the official duties
of his consular position remained to preoccupy him until the final
call.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides a host of friends, he left a wife, a son and a daughter to
mourn his passing; and while the idle reader of contemporary literature
may time and again derive pleasure and profit from his joyous
wit, and gentle philosophy, his intimates and brothers in soul
will seldom meet without recalling with a hush and a sigh the
friend and comrade who has passed and who awaits them where
work and worry, sweat and sorrow, are no more forever.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>He was buried in Holyhood Cemetery, Brookline, Mass., within
a stone’s throw of the spot where sleep his comrades in the flesh,
John Boyle O’Reilly, Thomas J. Gargan and Patrick A. Collins,
his grave marked by a handsome granite column adorned with a
bronze tablet, erected by a group of friends who loved him in life
and mourn him in death. May he sleep in peace; for no gentler,
sweeter spirit was ever added to the company of Heaven than James
Jeffrey Roche.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>After substantial justice had been done every part of the dinner, the
President-General asked for attention and said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<em>Ladies and Gentlemen, as well as Honored Guests of the American
Irish Historical Society</em>: If I feel somewhat overawed, somewhat
oppressed, by the consciousness of standing in the place formerly occupied
by a man of such national, nay, international, reputation as
the President-General whom I succeed, all the more is it incumbent
upon me on this occasion to take my duty very seriously, and endeavor
to discuss with the sobriety and earnestness appropriate to one of
my profession the aims which this organization has in view, and the
things to be sought after or avoided in prosecuting those aims.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me call your attention, particularly the attention of the many
new acquisitions whom I am so happy to see here tonight, to the five
words which form the motto upon our corporate seal: ‘<em>That the
world may know.</em>’ The interpretation put upon that legend by another
former President-General, Thomas J. Gargan, of whom I must
speak later on, was this: ‘To place the Irish element in its true
light in American history.’ It is not necessary to warn you, at this
stage of our existence as a body, that the American Irish Historical
Society does not live either to pick holes in the coats of others or
to trail its own coat over the sod by way of challenge. Rather, I
may say, the purpose of our organization is defensive; to employ the
armory of historical truth in vindicating for men of Irish blood that
place in American history of which it has been defrauded either wilfully
or through ignorance. Many causes have contributed to create
misrepresentation on the one hand and honest misconception on
the other. We need not discuss these causes in detail just at present.
I am here to deliver a general address and not a special lecture
in history. But we all know, and every well-informed American is
aware, that the ignorant and the vulgar not so very long ago had
but two well-defined ideas about Irishmen: One, that they wore
red whiskers and carried hods; the other, that they loved a fight.
The former of these errors we strive to dissipate—and I think we
have succeeded notably—by the very fact of the Society’s existence
and by the publication of the annual journal with its roster of membership.
As to the latter, we are not, I fear, in a position to deny it
without some reserve. It may, however, be fairly claimed that this
Society has already done much to proclaim its sympathy with the arts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of peace in electing a member of my profession to be the immediate
successor of such a man as Admiral McGowan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So far to establish what I take to be the solid reasons which justify
the existence of such a society as ours. Now let me call your
attention to an absolutely indispensable condition of our success in
the future, as it has been, I think, one great factor of our success in
the past. It is our aim to make better known the Irish pages of
American history. These pages do not refer, let us remember, to
any one section, type, class or creed of Irish-descended Americans,
but to all without discrimination. And this function of our Society
evidently will never be, could never have been, effectively discharged
without a hearty collective effort to sink all differences of religious
belief and of political connections. We must continue to act,
within our own body and in pursuit of our common object, independently
of those sectional, religious or political ties which bind us
individually as loyal citizens and as sincere Christians. From the
days of Brian Boru and of Dermot McMorough down to our own
time we know that that little isle where grows the ‘chosen leaf of
bard and chief’ has been a prey to the invader only because the invader
knew how to foment dissension among its native sons. Gentlemen,
this essential quality of our organization is both forcibly and
happily borne in upon us in these days when we hear that the land
of our fathers is at last beginning to assert its power as a political
unit by realizing that very idea of being ‘Irish first,’ that idea of
national unity, her neglect of which has been the comfort of her
enemies in times past.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Their proneness to dissension has been more or less facetiously
accounted for by the theory that the Irish are a nervously high-strung
race, who find a pleasant counter-irritant in the ‘man-enobling
conflict.’ It has been said that an Irishman would rather fight another
Irishman than a man of alien race, simply because he recognizes
in an antagonist of his own blood the most promising opportunity
of a truly exciting battle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The memory is still fresh upon me of that important event at
which I had the honor of assisting on the 16th of last month, the unveiling
of the beautiful tablet placed in the State House at Providence,
Rhode Island, to the glorious memory of Major-General
John Sullivan of Revolutionary fame. We all know that this
splendid and public-spirited memorial is one of the achievements of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the past year on which our Society has reason to congratulate itself.
Let the still fresh memory of that proud occasion be my excuse for
dwelling at such great length upon the warlike qualities of the Irish
race. For these qualities, in truth, are quite generally admitted by
both friends and enemies. Our more pressing call, it seems, is to emphasize
the achievements of the Irish race in peace. After listening
to those eloquent tributes in the Providence State House from
the lips of Governor Higgins, Ex-Governor Lippitt and others, it
was borne in upon me how easily a public man’s peaceful achievements
may be eclipsed by his military exploits. John Sullivan was,
as our tablet records, a statesman of distinction; as a jurist he left
his mark upon the legal history of New Hampshire, and yet it is
almost exclusively as the patriot soldier that he lives today in the
popular mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another hero of the American Revolution whose memory we must
tonight recall with especial satisfaction was Commodore John Barry.
We have the right, gentlemen, and I think that we should insist upon
it strenuously in these days, to call Barry the Irish father of that
splendid American navy of which we are all so justly proud. And
it is matter for congratulation that, since our last annual meeting,
and largely through our own organized efforts, historical justice is
now at last to be done to the man who was a commissioned Captain
in the American navy when Paul Jones was only a Lieutenant. A
prominent site has been officially chosen for a statue of Barry at the
national capitol, and we have every reason to hope that the work will
be executed by some sculptor of great repute of Irish descent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, proud as we must all feel of Irish services to the Republic
‘on the decks of fame’ and on many a stricken field, is it not rather
our duty as an organization to shed the light of history upon Irish
services in the council chamber and the law court, in science and
scholarship, and the fine arts? In the retrospect of the year that is
gone, what Irish-descended American can fail to thrill with pride at
the spectacle of that distinguished and at the same time enthusiastic
assembly which paid honor to the memory of Augustus St. Gaudens,
a native of Dublin, and the foremost American sculptor of our own
day?</p>

<p class='c013'>“And in this retrospect we have to include at least one example of
the type of Irish descendant which rises to eminence in the peaceful
professions in our late-lamented and highly-respected President-General,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Thomas J. Gargan, whose obsequies in Boston last fall were
the occasion of so impressive a manifestation of civic gratitude and
esteem. Surely his life was in itself a powerful effort to ‘place the
Irish element in its true light in American history.’ Eminent in the
legal profession in a community where the standards of that profession
are especially high, he also gave to the state of Massachusetts
as a trusted official such services as were duly acknowledged by the
presence in his funeral cortege of the Mayor of Boston, the present
and past Governors of Massachusetts, and an immense multitude of
citizens. And if this great lawyer’s career brilliantly illustrated the
truth that the Irish race excel in other things besides fighting I must
not pass over in silence that other departed fellow-member, Major
John Crane of New York, a man whose career was illustrious both
in war and in peace, a citizen who first turned his back upon commercial
success in order to take up arms for what he considered the
cause of the Republic, and then, when he had won glory for himself
in four years of active military service, returned to the peaceful pursuits
of commerce to achieve a place among the leading merchants of
New York, and at last to dispense his honorably-acquired wealth
and to apply his talents and his time in the charitable relief of poverty
and suffering.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have purposely left to the end of this retrospect my sincere tribute
to the memory of that man whose death, coming in the interval
since our last annual meeting, has been a peculiar loss to us as a
body. In addressing you two years ago, my distinguished predecessor,
Admiral McGowan, said, referring to our then Secretary,
Thomas Hamilton Murray: ‘A competent secretary is a priceless
possession for any society, and we have been especially fortunate in
this respect.’ The distinguished Admiral was speaking in the presence
of Mr. Murray when he uttered those words. What may we not
add now that death has removed the restraints imposed in such circumstances
by modesty and good taste. Thomas Hamilton Murray
was indeed a man to whom the American Irish will forever owe a
debt of gratitude for his work along that line which we, as a society,
have especially taken for our own. He was a journalist by profession,
an ornament, I may say, to American journalism, as so many
good American Irish have been; and before this Society had come
into existence he had already anticipated its aims, by rendering out
of his own initiative and his own exertions no insignificant service
toward placing the Irish element in its true light in American history.
From its very inauguration our Society was aware that no
other man in all the length and breadth of this country could have
held his position with so much advantage to the cause which we have
at heart. To say nothing of that which many of us must feel in the
removal of a dear friend, the Society cannot but be conscious of the
calamity it has sustained in the loss of this truly ‘priceless possession’
to whom our rapid success in the past has been so largely due.</p>
<div id='i_111'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>MICHAEL J. JORDAN.<br>  <br>  Of Boston, Mass.<br>  <br>  Vice-President of the Society for Massachusetts.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“In the year that has passed our Society has singularly suffered
from the loss of many of its ardent and enthusiastic workers. These
pioneers of our organization have been summoned from our midst,
but the heritage they have left is beyond measure or computation.
Their memory will always be fragrant with the sweetness of their
lives, and, whilst we chant their requiem, may they enjoy the hosannas
that are sung for them in their happier abode.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Coming now to the actual aspect of our life as an organization,
we may congratulate ourselves, I rejoice to say, upon a thoroughly
sound and vigorous condition. Most especially would I single out
for mention the astonishing success of our new membership committee.
That committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. John J. Linehan,
was appointed in New York City, I need hardly remind you,
scarcely two months ago, with the object of promoting the numerical
increase of our membership, while of course taking due care that its
quality should not fall below the standard which we had thus far
maintained. So zealously and efficiently has the work of the committee
been done, so just and cordial has been the appreciation of the
Society’s aims, that within one month 125 new and good names were
added to our roster, and the total increment, I believe, since the appointment
of the committee, amounts at the present moment to something
over 200. I am sure that we all heartily welcome these new
recruits, and in voicing that welcome let me express the hope that
every man of the new squad intends to do his utmost for the furtherance
of our great aims.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To do this, gentlemen, no mere machine action of the Society
will be adequate. Our work is, remember, a work of enlightenment,
therefore a work dealing with the intellect of our times and our
country, and not to be accomplished without intellectual exertion.
Now while societies, academies and universities have their immense
value as a directive and unifying apparatus, the intellectual forces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>which operate under their control must of necessity be individual.
To be effectual all effort must be controlled by system, but the most
perfect system without an abundance of individual effort must be like
an elaborately-constructed piece of artillery without a sufficient supply
of ammunition.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Our system has now been elaborated by the inauguration of the
<cite>Recorder</cite>, to be published at stated periods and which will serve as
a vehicle for such notices on topics of American Irish history as the
zeal and enterprise of individual members may prompt. It is confidentially
hoped that the supply of such material will be both abundant
and rich in quality, and that our <cite>Recorder</cite> will become in itself
a valuable magazine of information in those lines of research which
are the Society’s special province.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me even urge on members the advantage to our cause that
would be attained if every one of us will make a point of forwarding
to the Secretary-General, Judge Lee, who has assumed, in addition
to the many exacting duties of his present office, that of editor of
our <cite>Recorder</cite>, any newspaper clippings or other material concerning
contemporary happenings relating to our work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Finally, gentlemen, it is in no perfunctory spirit that I here publicly
render thanks to the members of our official staff, without whose
zealous coöperation our year could not have been brought to the happy
and glorious conclusion in which we rejoice tonight. Since the
death of our beloved Secretary-General six months ago Judge
Thomas Z. Lee of Rhode Island has fulfilled in large measure the
colossal duties of that office, and to whom the Society owes more
than mere words of thanks. With him I associate in my heartfelt
gratitude our esteemed and respected Treasurer-General, Mr.
Michael F. Dooley, whose devotion to our work and our interests has
been, I may say without exaggeration, heroic. And, gentlemen, I
must not conclude without expressing in both my own behalf and
that of the Society as a whole those thanks which are fairly due to
the various committees who have so successfully carried out the work
of organizing this meeting. I hold that the manner in which that
labor of love has been performed has been in itself a very positive
demonstration of the faculty of concerted action which belongs to
our race, at least on this side of the Atlantic, if not everywhere and
always. And now I conclude with my personal thanks to all who
are here tonight, especially the ladies, who have given a fine atmosphere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>to this occasion and without whose hearty and sympathetic
countenances our gathering could not have been, as I am confident it
will be, a memorable one in the history of the American Irish Historical
Society.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Hon. Patrick J. McCarthy</span>: “Rhode Island proposes three
cheers for the ladies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This suggestion met with a hearty response, and was quickly
followed by similar proposals from representatives of Boston and
New York.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>President-General Quinlan</span>: The first toast on the program
is “The President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was drunk standing and was followed by three ringing cheers.
The orchestra then played “The Star Spangled Banner,” which was
sung by the assemblage.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>President-General Quinlan</span>: We will now turn to the serious
aspect of this page in our history. This evening we are especially
honored, ladies and gentlemen, by having at this table one of the
most distinguished men, not only in the United States, but in the
world. Without further ado, without further expression, because it is
like carrying coals to Newcastle, I will go on and introduce to you
Hon. Edward D. White, Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States of America.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Justice White was greeted with hearty applause and cheering
as he arose, and, after order was restored, he spoke as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<em>Mr. President-General, Gentlemen of the American Irish Historical
Society, Ladies and Gentlemen</em>: When the privilege was extended
to me of coming here tonight there was also a request which
was by me declined, to respond to one of the set toasts. This was
done because it has been my wont since taking up judicial duty in
Washington to eschew as far as I could public speech-making, because
the thought has always been mine that if public speech-making
were indulged in, even occasionally, the habit might grow and thus
I might become what it seems to me is an abomination—a too loquacious
and indiscreet speech-making judge. Strange as it may
seem to any of you who have had to go over ponderous judicial opinions,
the result of judicial work is to cause one to hesitate about words.
They come to the one who does such work to be things which may
be productive of great wrong if misused or misapplied. True as
this is as to judicial work generally, it is more so when the character
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>of that work in our own country is considered. Under our system
judicial duty is not confined to the settlement of controversies between
men. It is more extensive, since it controls man in his relations
to government and the relations of government to the individual.
It involves the power to limit government itself, since
upon it is cast the ultimate duty to maintain the Constitution and
apply its limitations. It, therefore, in a sense not only restrains
both the national and State governments, but regulates their relations
one to the other. From this all-embracing extent of the
judicial authority it must be apparent that in our own country
much more than in any other the discharge of judicial duty
involves the dealing with subjects of the most acute public concern,
where passion and political agitation are flagrant. When these
things are considered it is certain that the performance of the judicial
function in our country—to paraphrase the words of the Romans—involves
the science of all things human and divine, the
knowledge of all things good and evil.</p>

<p class='c013'>“With these thoughts in my mind I stand up upon the generous
solicitation of your President and look into your kindly faces and
form the purpose to say a few words concerning your and my duty
to preserve the institutions of government with which we are blest,
and with the thought comes the admonition that I must be circumspect
and say nothing which ought not to be said. Indeed, as I speak,
there comes unbidden to my mind that beautiful prayer of the Catholic
Liturgy where the Priest, as he approaches the Gospel, invokes
the aid of Almighty God to cleanse his mouth as with a living coal
in order that his lips may be worthy to syllable the inspired subject
which he is about to approach.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Before I say anything further, however, let me briefly establish
my right to be among you tonight upon a more intimate basis than
that of a mere guest. This can hardly be done because of my being
an Irish American, for I am only of Irish blood on my father’s side
in the fourth generation. But my right to be one of you from another
point of view is quite apparent. In the state in which I was
born there lived an Irish American bearing the name of White. At
a public dinner—I do not believe it was an Irish American affair—he
sat near one whose name was O’Rourke. Leaning over to him he
said: ‘Mr. O’Rourke, what countryman are you?’ ‘What countryman?’
said O’Rourke. ‘I am an Irishman. Why do you ask me?’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>‘Because I thought from your name you might be a Frenchman,’ was
the reply. Quick came the retort: ‘That is more than I can think
of you, for I can kick a White out of every sod in Ireland.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“But there is a deeper claim than mere name on my part to be one
of you, since going back over my whole life from the time when I sat
as a boy learning to read out of a primer, down to this night, I can
look back to nothing of joy or sorrow, of success or failure, where
some Irish American friend did not stand near me aiding in the
realization or accomplishment of the one or sustaining and supporting
in submission to the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When the French Republic was born some one asked a great
French orator to prove its existence. He said: ‘The Republic is
like the sun; blind is he who sees it not.’ And so tonight I shall not
attempt to recount the many and priceless services from the days
of the Revolution to this time which the Irish American has rendered
to the upbuilding of this great and free country which we possess
and enjoy. Why should this be done, since their services shine down
the pathway of our national life with an effulgence so bright that
blind indeed must he be who sees them not.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The question which I ask myself, therefore, is not the superfluous
one of what the Irish Americans have done for our country, but what
they owe it. By what means were they enabled to render the great
services which they have rendered? The answer is clear. Their
possibilities arose from the wise, the free institutions which our forefathers
founded and under the shelter of which the Irish Americans
were enabled here to seek a haven and to establish their new homes,
thus affording them the opportunity of rendering the services which
they have rendered to the expansion and preservation of our institutions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This being true, I ask myself the question, and I ask of each one
of you, how best can we honor them? How best can we show our
appreciation of the great work which they have done? The answer
comes spontaneously to the mind: By preserving and perpetuating
those institutions which have blessed them so much and which they
have in return so helped to establish and preserve.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As I look, Mr. President, at present conditions in our country,
there are indications to my mind of great danger to our institutions.
It seems to me I observe a tendency in the minds of the people to
forget how vital to their perpetuation is the preservation of all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>wise limitations which our forefathers ordained. It seems to me
that there is a growing forgetfulness of the fact that the liberty
which our fathers founded was not license but a liberty restrained by
law; that the government which they established was one of limited
powers and divided authority, national and local, each fulfilling their
separate functions and each intended to move in their allotted sphere
like the orbs of the Sidereal universe, thus securing the plenitude
of local rights whilst at the same time obtaining national power and
authority, not unlimited, but confined to its allotted orbit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I say that it seems to me there is a tendency to forget these
things because it is observable at the present time that wherever an
evil obtains which needs remedying the tendency of the public mind
is to attribute the evil, not to a mistaken administration, but to the
existence of some one of those great safeguards upon the preservation
of which our institutions depend. So also it seems to me it is observable
that there is a great tendency in the public mind, whenever it is
deemed that a wrong requires remedy, to grow restive under the restraints
imposed by constitutional limitations, to regard them as antiquated
or obsolete, and thus seek to redress the wrong without regard
to those limitations, forgetful of the great truth that whatever
may be the temporary good to be accomplished by a disregard of the
fundamental limitations of our Constitution, such good is insignificant
in comparison with the untold harm which must result from
overthrowing the very foundations upon which our government rests
and by the adhering to which alone it can endure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Again, it seems to me that this tendency in the mind of the people
generally finds manifestation in the exertion of the powers of government.
There seems to me to be a growing tendency to chafe at
the limitations on power which the Constitution imposes; to seek to
accomplish some temporary good by means deemed to be the most direct,
wholly without reference to the question whether the resort to
such means will conflict with or set at naught those essential limitations
upon power which the Constitution was expressly adopted to
secure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“With this danger confronting us may I not say that if we would
honor and reverence the memory of the Irish Americans who have
done so much for the upbuilding of our institutions, that we may best
do it by seeing to it that the institutions which they have helped to
build up shall be preserved in all of their integrity. Ah, then, if
we would perform the duty of honoring those who have gone before,
let us each and all fix in our hearts the enduring purpose to see to
it that these evil tendencies are corrected and thereby renew and revivify
our resolution to preserve and perpetuate our institutions.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“With this in mind, before I take my seat let me propose to you
a toast: ‘The Irish American of today, and the Irish American to
come. May they honor and reverence the memory of their forerunners
by bringing the splendor of their courage, the generosity of
their devotion and the keenness of their intellect to the perpetuation
of the government which the fathers founded, embodying, as
it does, liberty restrained from license, government, both national and
local, with limited and defined powers in the continued existence of
which our future of peace and prosperity are bound up and in whose
perpetuation the hopes of all mankind who value true liberty are so
intimately involved.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Justice White’s eloquent and graceful address received the
closest attention, and great applause and cheering followed the stirring
toast at the end.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>President-General Quinlan</span>: “Ladies and Gentlemen, some
time ago I was present at an entertainment where the orator of
the occasion bore an international reputation. The chairman of
the evening took an hour and a quarter to introduce the gentleman,
but his speech lasted only a quarter of an hour. Now I could take
an hour and a half to introduce the next speaker to you, but I will
just announce his name, the Hon. Victor J. Dowling, Justice of the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, who will respond to the
toast “Irish Pioneers in New York.””</p>

<p class='c012'>Judge Dowling said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“While we know that an Irishman was in Columbus’ crew on his
first voyage to the New World, we have no means of ascertaining
whether any of his countrymen were on the ships of either Verrazano,
Gomez or Hudson, upon the first three occasions when the
Bay of New York was seen by Europeans. The mystery which
has enveloped the early life of Hudson and which shrouded his
end surrounds as well many of the details of his memorable
cruise. We do know that besides the captain there were but two
aboard that vessel out of its total equipment of from sixteen to
twenty men who spoke English—Robert Juet of Limehouse, England,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the captain’s clerk, who kept the journal of the voyage, and
one John Colman, a sailor, referred to as an Englishman by Juet,
but who may have been of Irish descent. He was evidently an experienced
seafaring man and a follower of Hudson’s, for in the first
known reference to the latter, which is the record of his voyage of
discovery for the Muscovy Company, April 19, 1607, in search of a
passage by way of the North Pole to Japan and China, Colman was
one of the sailors. As Hudson passed the Highlands of Navesink
September 1, 1609, and entered the lower bay, he was so impressed
with its beauty that he described it as ‘a very good land to fall in
with, and a pleasant land to see.’ On September 6 a boat’s crew was
dispatched from the ship and, entering and passing the Narrows, beheld
the first view of Manhattan Island. The land encircling the
bay was covered with trees, grass and flowers and the air was filled
with delightful fragrance. On their return the crew were attacked
by Indians in two canoes, and John Colman was killed by an arrow
piercing his throat—the first blood offering to the approaching civilization
which was to revolutionize the hitherto peaceful scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>“While the Dutch occupation of New Amsterdam continued, we
find no positive traces of Irish names or inhabitants, save in two instances.
One is the mention of the Irishman from Virginia who
went to confession to Father Jogues in 1643, while the latter was
temporarily sojourning in the town after his rescue by the Dutch
from the hands of the Indians, and who advised the latter of the
presence of Jesuit fathers in Virginia. The other is the name, several
times appearing, of ‘Thomas, the Irishman,’ concerning whom I
have been able to collect many scattered items. His real name was
Thomas Lewis, although he is to be found referred to at various
times as ‘Thomas, the Irishman,’ ‘the Irishman,’ and Lodewycksen or
Lodewycksz, as well as by his proper name. He was the captain of
one of Director Stuyvesant’s war yachts, which served for a dispatch-boat
as well.</p>

<p class='c013'>“His was an interesting career, and I am glad to be able to present
some of its salient features, which may enjoy at least the merits of
novelty. He was born in Belfast, and becoming involved in the
Cromwellian wars, his family was dispersed, his two sisters first flying
to Holland for refuge, where they afterwards died. They were
followed by Lewis, who upon their death applied to the West India
Company at Amsterdam and was by them sent to New York.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>In the Directors’ letter to Director Stuyvesant and his Council (June
14, 1656), they notify the latter: ‘In the ship <em>Blauwe Duiff</em> (Blue
Dove) goes also over Thomas Lodewicksen, carpenter, for whom the
Company, too, paid the fare, on condition of his remaining in New
Netherland for three years, or if he leave before he must refund the
passage money to you in Holland coin or its equivalent.’ The
<em>Blauwe Duiff</em> arrived here September 5, 1656. Lewis appears to
have gone to Albany (then Fort Orange) for in 1658 he was in partnership
there with Reynier Wisselpennigh as carpenters and builders
and they sued the local church for 270 guilders for building the
‘Doop-huysie’ (baptistry) and received the full amount. In 1661
his partner and he had differences over the cost of fitting out a sloop
they were building. He must have come to New Amsterdam
shortly thereafter, as the court records here show. In the meantime
he had married, in Fort Orange, Geesje Barents.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On October 17, 1662, Reiner Wisselpenninck brought suit against
‘Tomas, the Irishman’ in the Mayor’s Court at the City Hall, to recover
a balance of six beavers due for a half-interest in a bark, and
two beavers for a barrel of tar. Defendant counterclaimed and
plaintiff had judgment for three beavers only. On May 29, 1663,
certain tobacco contained in the bark of ‘Thomas, the Irishman’ and
belonging to Samuel Etsal was attached in a suit against the latter.
Hendrick Zanzen Smith sued Gysbert Frerickzen October 2, 1663,
and in that action an attachment was levied on moneys belonging to
defendant in the hands of ‘Thomas, the Irishman.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“In June, 1663, Director Stuyvesant sailed from Manhattan to
Wildwyck (Kingston) on Lewis’ yacht, and on the 15th of the
month while lying in the ‘Long Reach’ (North River) he sent a
message to the magistrates at Fort Orange, in the course of which
he noted ‘this is written in haste on board of the Irishman’s yacht.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the correspondence between Director Stuyvesant and Captain
Cregier at the Esopus and in the minutes of the government of the
latter reference is made five times in 1663 to the arrival of Lewis
at ‘the redoubt’ at Esopus from Manhattan; on August 5th, on September
1st (when he and Claesje Hoorn came in their yachts) and on
September 17th, 19th and 21st. On all these occasions he is referred
to as ‘Thomas, the Irishman.’ In an order of the Council, August
29, 1663, Tomos Lodewyck and Claes Lock were ordered to await
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>orders from Captain Cregier before the Redoubt (Roudont). This
was during the Indian war in the Esopus.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thomas Lewis was an active and successful man, and in addition
to being a ship-owner and pilot was evidently engaged in trade
and in the sale of liquor. He first figured in the Mayor’s Court
February 5, 1667, when he was sued by John Danrell, and the matter
was referred to arbitrators. On the 7th of the same month he
contributed eight beaver skins to the support of the minister. He
was engaged in a long controversy with Simon Turcq in 1668 over
230 planks, which he claimed to have theretofore paid, and out of
which rose a suit against Poulus Leenderson for ninety of the
same boards. In 1669 he was sued by Warner Wessels, the city
farmer, for taking into his house ’1 hogshead of rum and 3 anckers
of stilled waters’ without accounting therefor. This suit he won.
But he lost an action brought by Hendrick Obe to recover f.79.5 in
wampum for the excise duties on some wine and beer. At a Council
meeting held at Elizabethtown, New Jersey, November 7, 1671,
it was ordered that no corn or provision be transported out of the
Delaware River except what was then aboard the sloop of Thomas
Lewis, then in the river, for which he was given a special license.
In 1672 he sued William Waldron for borrowing his boat without his
consent, and then setting it adrift, when it was thereafter found by
John Benneco at Staten Island, who demanded salvage. The defendant
was mulcted in the salvage and was directed to turn the boat
over to the owner, who was to send his boy to the island to take possession
of it. At a council held at Fort James January 27, 1673,
permission was given to all vessels from this point to go up the Delaware
River above New Castle, upon producing the Governor’s certificate
in consequence of a complaint concerning Capt. Lewis’ sloop.
During the Dutch re-occupation of the city, when war again threatened,
we find in the ‘Records of New Amsterdam’ ‘that the Schout,
Burgomasters and Schepens being assembled “Collegialiter” in the
City Hall of New Orange March 10, 1674, they sent for the skippers
and barquers of the city, when they were notified of the Governor
General’s order that no more than two sloops shall go at once
to Willemstadt and Esopus, and one to the South river, and that
they sail alternately to be determined by lot; also that no passengers
be conveyed without passports.’ Whereupon the skippers making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>known in turn their views, ‘Thomas Lewis is satisfied with what the
Governor and Council decree.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“We find records of trips made by him to Virginia, Boston, Rhode
Island and the Delaware (South) River from 1665 to 1669, carrying
merchandise of all kinds. September 26, 1671, Governor Lovelace
promises ‘Mr. Tom’ at the Delaware to send him information
by Peter Alrick ‘who tomorrow will embark in Tom the Irishman’s
yacht.’ In 1675, he was appointed to make a calculation of the expense
for building a new church in conjunction with Adolph Pieters
and Abraham Jansen. We find that in 1678 he owned a sloop
called the <em>Katharine</em>.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In a list of the richest inhabitants of New York made February
19, 1674, Thomas Lewis is credited with the possession of property
valued at 6,000 florins, Holland currency, only sixteen appearing
therein as being wealthier. At the time of the English occupation
he owned real estate on the west side of Pearl Street between
Wall and William streets, then known as the Water Side,
then valued at $10,000; also on the South Street (now William) between
Hanover Square and Wall Street.</p>

<p class='c013'>“From the records of the baptisms in the Dutch church we learn
that he had eight children, named, respectively, Barent, Cornelia,
Leendert, Catharina, Cornelia, Thomas, Cornelis and Rachel. Anthony
Brockholst was one of the witnesses at the baptism of the last
named in 1678. The descendants of Barent, Leendert (or Leonard)
and Thomas are scattered throughout the Hudson Valley, and the
family name appears at various times in the records as Lenwis, Leuis,
Lieuwens, Lieuwes, Lieuwis, Lievens, Lievenszen, Lieuens, Liewensen,
Liewes, and Liewis. In the New York Genealogical and Biographical
Record (Volume XXXIV) the date of Thomas Lewis’
death is given as September 24, <a id='t121'></a>1684, and his age as 56. His will
was admitted to probate under Governor Dougan, April 1, 1686, and
letters testamentary were issued to his wife Geesie Lewis. She then
lived with her daughter Catharine along the Strand (Lang Strant)
and they were members of the Dutch church. Her sons then living
were Barent, Thomas and Leonard, with the eldest Lodiwick (apparently
born at Fort Orange) who at the time of his father’s death
was living with Lewis Thomson at Belfast, and thereupon returned
to New York, where he died without issue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But there are some names of merchants doing business here from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>1643 to 1647 which, if not English, must be Irish, and while the
present ascertainment of their exact nationality seems hopeless, yet
careful research might still enroll them in the honor roll of Irish
pioneers. These were Rev. Francis Doughty, the English minister,
residing in Pearl Street, between Whitehall and State streets, who on
March 28, 1647, received a grant of 6,666 (Dutch) acres of land at
Mespath (Newtown patent); Robert Butler, residing on the same
street, between Stone and Bridge streets; Michael Pickett, residing
on Broad Street, near Beaver; and Thomas Sanderson, residing
on Beaver Street, who received grants of land on this island July
13, 1643, October 25, 1653, and September 14, 1665.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There was a Jan Patrickx or John Patrick here in 1653 and a
James Code or Cody in 1658. Thomas Higgins was sued for value
of 275 pieces of firewood on November 20, 1661, and by Thomas
Hall for the return of a saw January 31, 1662.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Among the names of those to whom grants of land under the
Dutch occupancy were made were Thomas Hall, Thomas Chambers
and George Holmes, each receiving more than one grant; the first
two took the oath of allegiance to the English authorities between
October 21 and 26, 1664.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The English capture of New Amsterdam in 1664 did not, so far
as we have any records, lead to any influx of Irish settlers here. So
novel was their coming that we find reference made as a remarkable
fact to the presence of the person, unnamed, who is supposed to
have been the first direct Irish immigrant to New York, being an
Irish girl, a servant in the household of Isaac Allerton, a well-known
English tobacco merchant, and who was working therein in 1665,
shortly after the English occupation. Little could she have dreamt of
the host of her sister voyagers who brought to this country the spirit
of devotion, of self-sacrifice, of faithful discharge of duty, which ultimately
forced itself upon the grudgingly-given attention of the
community and admiration for which as well as for the tenderness
and purity of the women of the Irish race was the most potent force
in tearing down the wall of hostility and hatred which intolerance
and ignorance had reared in the way of the progress of the Irishmen
in this country towards recognition, equality and success.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“Patrick Hayes must have been a resident of the city for some
years. He apparently came from the colony of Maryland. We find
a record of his service as a juryman in the Mayor’s Court on many
occasions during the year 1666. He evidently was a tapster and
hotel-keeper, for he had controversy with the excise in 1667. He
must have been engaged in general business as well, for in suits between
third parties moneys were attached in his hands in 1667 and
he sued various parties for goods sold in 1667 and 1668. In two
of these cases Thomas Carr was a joint plaintiff. In the action of
William Urgent against John Ashman for slander, June 2, 1668, he
was a witness to prove his knowledge of the plaintiff as a freeman
in the province of Maryland. John Daaly was a plaintiff in two
suits in the Mayor’s Court in 1670. John Quigly figures as a
plaintiff in the Mayor’s Court against Ralph Huddison August 15,
1671, when he sued successfully to recover £16, 10 sh., for earthenware
sold. He served as a juror in the same month, and was one
of the arbitrators appointed in the suit of Samuel Bach and David
Gomer against the Ketch Betty (attached). Dennis McKarty sued
Thomas Edwards, master of the Ketch ‘Society’ in the Mayor’s
Court October 24, 1671, to recover £5 for cutting and chipping logwood,
and recovered judgment. He was himself sued by Samuel
Hall November 14, 1671. Thomas Griffin was one of the public
cartmen of the city February 13, 1672.</p>

<p class='c013'>“During the intervening years, until the Dutch re-occupation in
1673, when its name was changed to New Orange, the city saw but
few Irish faces and the list of the burghers contains no Irish names.
Upon the re-cession of the city to England in 1674, when English
rule became an assured fact, it is reasonable to suppose that some
Irish arrivals must have been noted. Yet we can only surmise that
from the names as we afterwards find them on the rolls. So, in
1674, Andrew Clare is recorded as owning land on Pearl Street, between
Whitehall and State streets; in 1677, we note as residing here,
William Walsh; in 1680, Abraham Corbett, a distiller, residing on
Broadway near Exchange Place, and William Cox, flour merchant,
residing on Hanover Square; in 1691, Lawrence Reade; in 1695,
John Morris and Peter Matthews; in 1698, William Morris; in
1702, Thomas Flynn, surgeon, and Patrick Crawford; in 1703,
John Barr, Thomas Carroll, Richard Flemming, Bartholomew Hart,
Henry Mooney and Peter Moran; in 1708, Anthony Lynch; in 1710,
Thomas Kearney; in 1711, James Maxwell. All these were freemen.
In 1696, the then Governor Fletcher returned to the home
authorities a list of eleven Irish Catholics residing in the city, none
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>of whom was a burgher nor a landowner. Captain Evans, of the
<em>Richmond</em> frigate, who was here with the Governor, was the son of
an Irish shoemaker.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is significant that we first begin to notice Irish names after
the administration of Governor Dongan had commenced. The commanding
position held by an Irishman for the first time in Colonial
history must have attracted to this colony many of his less favored
compatriots, who found here not only a haven of refuge where they
could practise their religion, but a favored spot where under his enlightened
sway the hope of entire civil liberty was near realization.
The life and services of Thomas Dongan have never received their
just recognition at the hands of historians, nor do we realize the debt,
which, as citizens of a great city, we owe this man whose conceptions
of liberty were far in advance of his time. At the risk of triteness
I cannot forbear epitomizing his career, for it is that of the first
Irishman who not only figured prominently in the city’s history,
but, as well, moulded its future and made it possible of achievement.
Thomas Dongan, second Earl of Limerick, was born in 1634 at
Castletown, County Kildare, Ireland, the youngest of the three sons
of Sir John Dongan, Baronet. His mother was a sister of Richard
Talbot, Earl of Tyrconnel and Lieutenant-Governor of Ireland.
The family removed to France after the execution of Charles I,
when Dongan entered the army and was commissioned by Louis
XIV, in an Irish regiment, where he rose by degrees to the rank of
Colonel. Returning to England after the Restoration, after declining
an offer of preferment in the French Army, he was commissioned
and an annual pension of five hundred pounds given him. In
the same year, 1678, he was sent as Lieutenant-Governor to Tangier
under Lord Inchiquin, where he served for two years, returning
to London to spend the life of a man of society and a favorite
at Court. Through the influence of the Duke of York he was made
Governor of the Province of New York, his jurisdiction including
parts of Maine besides Long Island, Martha’s Vineyard, Nantucket
and all the land from the Connecticut River to Delaware Bay. He
was also commissioned Vice-Admiral. Arriving in New York
August 25, 1683, from Nantasket, he had on the way hither promised
the inhabitants of the easterly end of Long Island that ‘no laws
or rates for the future should be imposed but by a General Assembly’—but
a slight foretaste of what he was really to accomplish.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>The population of the city was then less than four thousand and it
extended from the Bay to the entrenchments along Wall Street.
From the Collect Pond (the site of the Tombs) to the northwest
towards the North River extended a marsh of seventy acres. From
the Bouweries to Harlem there stretched a wood haunted by bears
and wolves, and within the city walls themselves bear hunts took
place in the orchards, one located between Cedar Street and Maiden
Lane. Under his rule, general hunts were held to exterminate wolves
from the city. The inhabitants were largely Dutch, but there were
many French Huguenots and some few English. In this rather
primitive community, great things were about to be done for liberty.
Pursuant to his instructions from the Duke, Dongan ordered an election
of a ‘General Assembly of all the freeholders by the persons
whom they shall choose to represent them,’ in order to consider with
the Governor and Council ‘what laws are fit and necessary to be
made and established for the good weal and government of the said
colony and its dependencies and all the inhabitants thereof,’ with
full liberty of consultation and debate among the members. All
laws passed were to be subject to the veto of the Governor, and if
approved by him were to be submitted to the Duke of York, remaining
effective until disapproved by him. It is to the glory of
Dongan that he not only approved but initiated many of the revolutionary
measures afterwards enacted. On September 13, 1683, a
date memorable in the city’s history, the Freeholders of New York,
Long Island, Esopus, Albany and Martha’s Vineyard were notified
to elect representatives to meet in General Assembly in New York
City on October 17th. Seventeen delegates responded, whereof four
were from New York and Harlem. This first popular representative
assembly met at Fort James, and Matthias Nicoll was speaker.
Fourteen acts were passed, whereof the most important was, ‘The
Charter of Liberties and Privileges granted by His Royal Highness
to the inhabitants of New York and its dependencies.’ This was
declared to be enacted ‘for the better establishing the government of
this province of New York, and that justice and right may be equally
done within the same.’ Among the provisions of this well-named
Charter of Liberties were those providing for at least a triennial session
of the General Assembly; that every freeholder and freeman
should have the elective franchise without constraint or imposition;
that majorities should decide every issue; that representatives should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>be apportioned among the counties; that the members should enjoy
all the privileges of members of Parliament; and in fine extending to
the inhabitants of this colony all the rights and privileges which
Englishmen at home enjoyed under Magna Charta and the provisions
of English law. Entire freedom of conscience and of religion were
guaranteed to all peaceable persons ‘which profess faith in God by
Jesus Christ,’ and the privileges of all existing churches and their
discipline were protected. No tax was to be levied without the consent
of the Governor, Council and Assembly, thus recognizing the
principle which the people had wrested from Mary of Burgundy, in
1477, by the charter called ‘The Great Privilege.’ And thus, for
the first time in America, the people were recognized as having legislative
power and authority. Accepted by the Governor and proclaimed
October 31, 1683, a new standard was set for popular liberty
and popular aspiration so that Governor Hunter was able to write
to Dean Swift, in 1704, ‘this is the plan of government they all
aim at and make no scruple to own.’ The Duke of York accepted
this charter October 4, 1684, but when he became King James II he
refused to confirm it as being too liberal and implying too much
recognition of the people as a political entity, and it died by his
veto October 4, 1684. But the seed had been sown, and its growth
could not be stopped. At the same session, courts of justice were by
statute provided for; the naturalization of aliens was prescribed,
and twelve counties were established in the province. To add to
the other landmarks of his administration, a charter was granted to
New York City April 27, 1686, which has since continued to be the
basis of our municipal laws, rights, privileges, public property and
franchises. ‘It was worded with care and showed that those who
framed it were possessed of a broad and enlightened sense of the
sanctity of corporate and private rights.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“During all his busy rule, Dongan was kept occupied with questions
of statesmanship which none but an able and resourceful man
could have handled; whether adjusting boundary disputes with New
Jersey, Pennsylvania or Connecticut, or outgeneralling the Governor
General of Canada at his own game; whether negotiating with the
Indians or planning combinations with the other colonies to resist
French aggression or undertake offense operations;—in every phase
of his varied activities he displayed resourcefulness, tact and power.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He was a humane man. Under the Duke’s laws, in force from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>1665 to 1683, no Christian could keep a slave; but the New Yorkers,
being unable to keep pace with the New Englanders, who habitually
used their services, slaves were allowed to be kept by orders from
England. But in the instructions which Dongan issued May 29,
1686, it was directed that no cruelty should be practised upon them,
and the wilful killing of Indians and negroes was to be punished
with death. We find as well on October 6, 1687, he proposed to
his Council that some means be found for releasing Spaniards and
other free people who were held here as slaves and that he forbade
their masters either to sell or trade such persons pending their appeal
for liberty. Again, July 30, 1688, he ordered that ‘all Indian slaves
within the province, subjects of the King of Spain, that can give an
account of their Christian faith and say the Lord’s Prayer shall be
forthwith set at liberty, and sent home at the first convenience, and
likewise them that shall hereafter come to this Province.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The troubles accumulating in England found their echo here
and the King prohibited the establishing of printing-presses here,
and on January 20, 1687, dissolved the popular Assembly. In that
year Dongan wrote ‘one of the most careful as well as most honest
pictures of his provincial government which an American subordinate
ever sent home to his English sovereign.’ In the course
of it he says: ‘I believe for these seven years past there has not
come over into this province twenty English, Scotch or Irish families.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The entire winter of 1687 he spent at Albany, supervising the
protection of the colony against the French, and being without financial
help from the other settlements, he pledged his personal credit
and mortgaged his farm on Staten Island for £2,000 to meet the
expenses of the expedition then raised.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On March 23, 1688, he was superseded as Governor by Andros,
who was made Governor General of New England in America, comprising
all of British North America, except Pennsylvania. Dongan
was offered the rank of Major General, which he refused in order
to remain in New York. His homestead was at Hempstead,
Long Island. He owned a hunting lodge on his estates at Castleton,
Staten Island, which were named after his original home; and
he had property at Martha’s Vineyard as well. His city residence
was on Broadway, between Maiden Lane and Ann Street, where his
flower garden was a special feature. Between these places he spent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>his time, seeking to rebuild his fortune, severely shattered by his
expenditures for the protection of the colony he loved, until the
reins of power fell into the hands of Jacob Leisler, after the flight
of James II to France, when Dongan was hunted as a rebel and
enemy of the new régime, and driven to seek refuge on his brigantine,
on which he kept in hiding in the lower Bay. The winds being
adverse, he was unable to sail away, and flying to New York in
secret, thence to New London, to Hempstead, to New Jersey, and to
Boston the first advocate of popular rights was finally forced to
escape the persecutions of the people, whose liberties he had assured,
by sailing to England in 1691. Never repaid any considerable
part of the fortune he had spent to defend the honor of his country
and the safety of her colony, he died, without issue, December 14,
1715, at the age of eighty-one years. With him the history of Irish
activity in New York may well be said to begin. While he came
here as an official, he identified himself with the Colony and with
the City, and grew so to love it that no honors appealed to him
which involved leaving it. To have been the means of assisting in
conferring upon a people popular government, civic liberty and religious
freedom in an age of despotism and persecution, is an honor
which reflects credit upon the race to which he belonged, as well as
upon himself. He has been characterized by historians as ‘an excellent
and prudent magistrate’ (Winsor); ‘a man of integrity,
moderation and genteel manners, who may be classed among the
best of our governors’ (Smith); ‘his firm and judicious policy, his
steadfast integrity and his pleasing and courteous address soon won
the affections of the people and made him one of the most popular
of the Royal governors’ (Booth); ‘of a noble, praiseworthy mind
and spirit’ (Gov. Hinckley); ‘a ruler who for breadth of mind, wide
sympathy and executive ability stands far in advance of his times
and measured by the system of government which he inaugurated, is
easily one of the most attractive and momentous personages in American
Colonial History’ (Driscoll). It is significant that this great
Irish pioneer should have been an office holder, a tradition which the
race did not forget when its hour of opportunity arrived. It may be
said at this time that three other royal governors of the colony were
of Irish birth, the Earl of Bellomont, who served from 1698, and
who was the son of Baron Coote of Colooney; William Cosby, who
arrived August 1, 1732, and who was an Equerry of the Queen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Colonel of the Royal Irish Regiment and the tenth son of Alexander
Cosby of Stradbally, Queens County; and Sir William Tryon, the
last of the line. But no one of these ever identified himself with
the colony or is to be reckoned with as a constructive force.</p>

<p class='c013'>“After Dongan departs from the scene, we again have a long
period of silence upon Irishmen in New York. The meagerness of
detail as to anything affecting their names, their activities or their
achievements is disheartening. Much of it may be attributed to the
lack of wealth or social standing upon the part of those who immigrated
here in the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the
eighteenth centuries. Much may be charged to their desire to conceal
themselves from persecution and worse. There must have been
refugees here from Virginia, New England and the Barbadoes,
where penal laws were savagely enforced. Maryland must have furnished
its quota when religious liberty was abolished. But New
York seems never to have been so favorite a resort for the persecuted
as Pennsylvania. Then again many redemptioners must have come
here, when their time of service had expired. These were the immigrants
who were unable to pay their passage and who on arriving
were sold for a specified time to those who would reimburse the ship
captain for their carriage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In October, 1700, a number of recruits arrived in New York
from Ireland, and one of them, Cottrill, a former ensign in King
James’ army, was shot in the Fort here for participation in a
mutiny. It is evident from reading the record that these men had
been impressed into the service and coming here involuntarily, sought
freedom on their arrival. In the answers which Brigadier Hunter
sent to Secretary Popple, August 11, 1720, he wrote: ‘The inhabitants
increase day by day from New England, and of late from
the North of Ireland.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Among the North of Ireland emigrants to New York are many
who figured prominently in the religious life of the colony. Rev.
Charles Inglis, afterwards Rector of Trinity Church, came here
as a missionary in 1759. In 1766 Philip Embury arrived, and
helped to found the John Street Church. He is among the pioneers
of the Methodist Episcopal Church in America. In that year Paul
Runkle, Luke Rose, Jacob Heck, Peter Barkman and Henry Williams,
all referred to as Irish Palatines, landed. Charles White and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Richard Sause, prominent in Methodist circles, came from Dublin
in 1766, and later, John McClaskey and Paul Hick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Major Henry Dawson left Dublin in 1760 and resided here for
many years, serving as Clerk of the Common Council for twenty-six
years.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Among the freemen of the city we find the following significant
names: 1740, Bartholomew Ryan; 1741, John Ryan and John
Lamb; 1743, Patrick Phagan, John McGie, John Christie, John
Brannigan, John Connelly, Andrew Cannon, William Blake; 1744,
Andrew Carroll, Anthony Glin; 1745, Benjamin Daly, John Carr,
Bryan Nevin; 1746, Donald McCoy, Hugh Rogers; 1747, Timothy
Allan, Hugh Mulligan, James Welch, Hugh Gill, John McGoers,
Jr., Alexander McCoy; 1748, Philip Hogan, Matthew Morris; 1749,
Alexander Connelly, physician. In 1761 the poll list included seventy-four
characteristic Irish names.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Immigration from Ireland to the colonies in general did not
become noticeable until 1718. It was then a steady influx, though
not very large in numbers, until 1755, when it fell off and remained
of less amount until after the Revolution. At the outset, the Irish
families immigrating were almost entirely Presbyterians. The first
Presbyterian clergyman in New York was Rev. Francis McKemie,
born in Ireland, who arrived here in 1707. He was a brave and fearless
man, whose pulpit utterances led to his trial for libel, upon which
he was acquitted. The large Catholic exodus did not begin until after
our Independence had been achieved. A prominent citizen of New
York in the eighteenth century was Sir Peter Warren, born in
County Meath in 1702, and the uncle of the famous William Johnson,
also born in County Meath in 1715, whose life is a romance.
Warren was a very heavy real estate holder in the city, owning 260
acres here, much of his holdings being of land which since has become
enormously valuable. Warren Street is named after him. He
was a prominent social figure in Colonial life. Among the names
of those who were active in commercial life in New York City, prior
to the Revolution, are many Irishmen, who figured as some of the
most successful and reputable merchants of their time. Such were
the two Wallaces, Alexander and Hugh, who were in business from
1750, Hugh being the second President of the Chamber of Commerce;
Miles Sherbrooke, one of the founders of the Chamber in
1768, and a member of the Committee of Correspondence, the advance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>guard of the Revolution; Patrick McDavitt, an auctioneer in
Kings Street, from 1768; Alexander Mulligan, an importer of Irish
goods, beef, linen and other commodities; Hercules Mulligan, a merchant
tailor; Oliver Templeton, an auctioneer; Daniel McCormick,
also an auctioneer. During the time of the Revolution and following
it, we find the names of Michael Connolly, dealer in lumber;
William and James Constable, in the West Indian, China and Indian
trade; the Pollocks, Carlisle, George and Hugh; John Haggerty,
an auctioneer; William Edgar; John Glover; John W. and
Philip Kearney, commission merchandise; John and Nathan
McVickar, linen drapers; Alexander McComb, a fur dealer and then
a land speculator, who invested heavily in city real estate; and Michael
Hogan, in the commission and shipping business, who owned,
and in memory of his birthplace in County Clare, named the northern
part of his holdings, Claremont. All these men were representative,
flourishing men, who stood as high in public esteem as any
of the residents of the city of that day. They were all either Irish
by birth or by immediate descent. How many of their poorer fellow-countrymen
were then here we have no means of knowing, but it is
significant that while the Jews had a synagogue here from 1730, there
was no Catholic place of worship from the time when Dongan had
Mass said within the Fort until the year 1786.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lieutenant-General John Maunsell was born in 1724, the son of
Richard Maunsell of Limerick, a member of Parliament from 1741
to 1761. Commissioned as an ensign in 1741, he was at the sieges
of Louisburg, Quebec, Montreal, Martinique and Havana, during
which time he rose to be Captain and finally in 1761 Major of the
60th or Royal Americans. He was gazetted for gallantry Lieutenant-Colonel
of the 83d Regiment October 31, 1762, and was thereafter
transferred to the 27th Foot (Iniskillings). He had received
for his services a grant of land adjoining Major Skene’s at Whitehall
(old Skenesborough). Coming to New York City, he married
for his second wife Elizabeth Stillwell, widow of Captain Peter
Wraxall, at Trinity Church, June 11, 1763. He lived here with
his wife at Greenwich, in the Ninth Ward, in property belonging
to Oliver DeLancey, until he sailed for England with other loyalists
in May, 1775, leaving his wife behind him. Returning for her
in 1776, he then went to Kinsale, in Ireland, where he had received
an appointment which he had requested in order to avoid serving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>against the Colonies. October 19, 1781, he was gazetted Major-General
on half pay in the Irish Establishment. Living in London
until 1784 he resided in New York continuously thereafter, his city
house being at 11 Broadway. He was made Lieutenant-General October
12, 1793. He owned a farm of 60 acres on Harlem Heights,
between Morris and Watkins places, the site now being divided by
St. Nicholas Avenue. He died July 27, 1795, and was buried in
the Bradhurst vault in Trinity Cemetery.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another striking figure of pre-Revolutionary days, and an aggressive
if unpopular one, was Hugh Gaine, the printer. And it is
strange that after Bradford and Franklin, the two great figures in
the early history of printing in America should be those of Irishmen—Gaine
in New York and Matthew Carey in Philadelphia. Gaine
has been a much-abused man and was very unpopular during the
Revolutionary period, but he is an example of a successful business
man. Born at Belfast in 1726, he was apprenticed at an early age
to James McGee, a printer there. He emigrated to New York in
1745 ‘without basket or burden,’ and secured employment with
James Parker at wages of $1.25 a week. He went into the business
of bookselling in 1752 in partnership with William Weyman, a
former apprentice of William Bradford. A characteristic advertisement
of the period is the following: ‘To be sold by Weyman &#38;
Gaine at their House on Hunters’ Key, next door but one to Mr.
Perry’s, Watchmaker; Bibles of different Sizes, with and without
the Common Prayer; gilt and plain Common Prayers of most sorts,
Church and Meeting Psalm Books, History of the New Testament,
History of the Five Indian Nations, Account of the Earthquake at
Lima, Ovid’s Metamorphosis, Virgil, Cornelius Nepos, Mariners’
Compasses, Scales and Dividers, Writing paper by the Quire or
Sheet, also choice good Bonnet Papers.’ On August 3, 1752, Gaine
alone commenced the publication of the <cite>New York Mercury</cite> at the
same store, the subscription being twelve shillings per year, and advertisements
of a moderate length were published for five shillings
each. He sold books and stationery as well at this time, and his was
one of two stores where theatre tickets were sold. After various
migrations the business was finally located at the Bible and Crown
in Hanover Square in 1745. During a bitter controversy caused by
the attempt of the Presbyterians to curb what they thought was the
undue dominance of the Episcopalians, a letter in the form of a
petition ostensibly coming from the Irish residents in New York, was
sent by a committee for insertion in the <cite>Mercury</cite>, to be published
anonymously; but the letter was in bad English, misspelled and
full of ridiculous exaggerations—all purposely done—and Gaine
refused to print it as a reflection on the Irish nation, of which he
was proud. <cite>The Mercury</cite>, in 1758, in announcing the fall of Louisburg,
printed a wood cut diagram of the fortress—an unusual piece
of enterprise for the times. That printers did not then consider advertising
the principal feature of their papers may be inferred from
his apology in an issue of 1759: ‘We hope those of our customers
whose advertisements are omitted this week will not take it amiss, it
being occasioned by the agreeable advice received from the Fleet
and Army at Quebec.’ In this connection it may be noted that in
1755 he had offered for sale ‘A very few brass mounted Broad
Swords, late the property of his Most Christian Majesty; so that
the purchaser, in case of a French war, will have the advantage of
his enemies, as he can encounter them with their own weapons.’ He
offered for sale at various times corkscrews, razors and wafers;
playing cards, blacking balls and liquid blacking; boots, pumps and
shoes; hogs’ fat, shaving soap and German flutes; a parcel of
choice Irish butter, lottery tickets and patent medicines.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“Many books issued from his press, including a series of almanacs.
But his bookselling and newspaper furnished his chief source of
wealth. His paper was delivered in the city by messenger. We find
him advertising in 1780: ‘Wanted, a Person that will engage to
deliver this paper to the Customers in Town for twelve months or
longer. Good encouragement will be given. He need not attend
more than four hours every Monday.’ Printing paper being scarce,
he continually advertised for rags to be brought to him for purchase
and in 1760 he commenced advertising in this form: ‘Ready
money for clean Linen Rags to be had at H. Gaines’.’ In 1773 a
paper mill was established at Hempstead by him and two of his
friends.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Among the important printing done by his press was ‘The Votes
and Proceedings of the General Assembly,’ whereof the first volume
appeared in 1764, the second in 1766. Appointed Public Printer
by the colony, January 15, 1768, he also became the official City
printer. General Gage’s famous proclamation of June 12, 1775,
was printed by him, the work being done here that it might remain a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>secret in Boston until published. Up to this time Gaine had given
every proof of being in sympathy with the cause of freedom, so that
he was forced to fly to Newark when the British occupied New York
in 1776. The authorities seized his printing plant here and published
the <cite>New York Gazette</cite> therefrom, using his name for a time
as proprietor. Tiring of his exile, he evidently made terms with
the invaders, for he returned to New York and his business was
restored to him, the first issue of the resumed paper dating from
November 11, 1776, leaving behind him his press at Newark, which
was promptly seized by the patriots and a paper printed thereon for
some time. From this time on he was a thorough going Tory, and
was the subject of particularly virulent attack from the Americans,
the <cite>Pennsylvania Journal</cite> in 1777 for example enquiring: ‘Who is
the greatest liar upon earth? Hugh Gaine of New York.’ But he
lived through the turmoil and after freedom was obtained, he continued
doing business. In 1788, against violent protest, he received
the contract for printing the paper money for the State of
New York. He was Treasurer and Vice-President of the St. Patrick’s
Society, a vestryman of Trinity Church and an active Mason.
He owned a country home at Kings Bridge Road, and a large tract
of land at Canajoharie. He bought and sold land in the city, there
being records of twenty-four parcels of land sold by himself or his
executors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gaine died April 27, 1807, at the ripe age of eighty-one, and was
buried in Trinity Churchyard. Two of his children had predeceased
him, and three survived, as well as his second wife. His
executors were his son-in-law, John Kemp, and his friends Richard
Harrison and Daniel McCormick, the latter already referred to.
His lines had not fallen in pleasant places during the Revolution
and his abandonment of the patriot cause was never entirely forgiven,
but as a business man his integrity was never questioned.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is not my purpose to refer to Irish activity in the city during
Revolutionary days, for that would be a field worthy of independent
study and treatment. The roll of the martyrs of the <em>Jersey</em> prison
ship, for example, is studded with Irish names. Nor is it pertinent
to our subject, for no pioneers came here then, as the tide of immigration
practically stopped during the war, although it is worthy of
note that Richard Montgomery, destined to undying fame, bought a
farm at Kingsbridge in 1773, and had intended to make this city his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>home. He was born at Swords, near Feltrim, Ireland. Like nearly
all the Irish of New York, he did not hesitate a moment before casting
his life and fortune into the balance when the call to arms came.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But after the declaration of peace the Irish Catholic influx began.
Among those whose names have survived, no one stands higher than
Dominick Lynch. Born in Galway in 1754, he received a thorough
education and went to Bruges in Flanders to open a commercial
house, in which he accumulated a fortune. There he met Don
Thomas Stoughton (afterwards his brother-in-law and Spanish Consul
at New York) with whom he entered into partnership for the
establishment of business in New York. Stoughton came here first,
arriving in 1783, and Lynch followed in 1785, with his fortune in
ready money, the largest sum brought to the colonies in many years.
The firm dissolved in 1795. Lynch lived in luxury, occupying a
house on Broadway, near the Battery, adjoining that of the Spanish
Minister. He was a prominent figure in assisting in the establishment
of the first Catholic Church in New York. Tradition has it
that the first Catholic congregation worshipped in Ann Street, where
they were ministered to by Rev. Ferdinand Farmer, and we find
later a record of another composed of Frenchmen and Spaniards,
who met in a building in Warren Street, known as Vaux Hall, where
Rev. Charles Whelan, a Capuchin, was their pastor in 1784. St.
Peter’s Church was incorporated, succeeding them, June 10, 1785.
Lynch helped from his private purse to meet their needs and was one
of the trustees and incorporators. He issued an appeal to the people
of Galway for funds to help in building the church, most of the
Irish in the fold coming from that County. He was one of the
laymen authorized by Bishop Carroll to receive subscriptions for the
establishment of Georgetown Academy (now the University) and
was one of the signers of the address on behalf of the Catholics of
America to General George Washington, four being laymen, and
Bishop Carroll, the fifth. One of his sons was baptized in St.
Peter’s Church—Alexander Didacus—born April 23, 1788, and for
whom His Excellency Didacus de Gardoqui, Ambassador of Spain,
was a sponsor. He owned two thousand acres of land adjoining
Fort Stanwix on the Mohawk River, where he laid out a village
called Lynchville, which afterwards became the city of Rome. His
county seat was in Westchester County, on the site of the present
Sacred Heart Academy, at Classon-on-the-Sound, said to have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>the place where Mass was first said in that county. He died June,
1825, and was buried in Old Saint Patricks. His son, Dominick,
was a vocalist, musician, musical critic and general society favorite,
whose house was the favored resort of the most brilliant people of
his time. He lived in Greenwich Street, near the Battery, and is
thought to have been instrumental with Lorenzo da Ponte, the
librettist of “Don Giovanni” and “Le Nozze di Figaro,” in having
brought to New York the first Italian Grand Opera troupe under
Garcia, when Mme. Malibran first won success and laid the foundation
of her fame.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Cornelius Heeney, born in Kings County, Ireland, in 1754, was
another contemporaneous successful merchant. He was a bookkeeper
for William Backhous, an English Quaker furrier, at 40
Little Dock (now Water) Street. John Jacob Astor was a porter
and salesman there. When Backhous retired from business he turned
it over to Astor and Heeney, who afterwards dissolved partnership.
He was a very wealthy and a very charitable man, and his benefactions
still continue, through the agencies he created, to maintain
them. He was one of those who took title to new Saint Patricks,
the other being Andrew Morris, a successful soapmaker, also born
in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A trio of great men who came to New York after the rising of
’98 were Thomas Addis Emmet, Dr. William James McNevin and
William Sampson. The lives, high professional attainments and
success of the first two are too well known to require more than a
passing reference. They did immeasurable good in instilling respect
for Irish characteristics and admiration for Irish genius. Emmet
exercised a potent influence on the early political history of
the country. His location in this city, instead of going to Ohio
as he had intended, was due to the advice of Governor George
Clinton, and was followed by his election as Attorney-General
of the State within eight years after his reaching these shores.
The monument to his memory in St. Paul’s churchyard is a fitting
companion to the memorial to General Montgomery. He collaborated
with Doctor MacNevin in the production of ‘Pieces of
Irish History.’ Doctor MacNevin, in the midst of a busy and
highly lucrative practice, and while acting as a professor in a
medical college, found time to establish a bureau to obtain places for
Irish servant girls, and to publish “Directions or Advice to Irishmen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Arriving in America.” William Sampson, the third of the
number, was born in Londonderry, Ireland, January 17, 1764. He
held a commission in the Irish Volunteers, after studying at Dublin
University and being admitted as a barrister. His sympathy with
the patriots and his brilliant professional defense of members of the
United Irishmen led to his arrest after the uprising and his confinement
in prison for some time. After his release he was re-arrested
in Portugal, whither he had gone for safety, and was imprisoned on
the complaint of the British Government. Secretly taken to France,
he finally came to New York, arriving here July 4, 1806. He then
practised stenography, as well as his profession of the law, ranking
second only to Thomas Lloyd, the great reporter of Congress, as a
shorthand writer. His notes furnished the basis of many volumes of
reports. But as a lawyer he was especially successful and made a
reputation for wit, forcefulness, ability and integrity. His daughter
married a son of Theobold Wolf Tone. When Sampson removed to
Washington in 1825, he was presented with an address from the
citizens of New York, among the signers being James Kent and
DeWitt Clinton.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The years after the Revolution were fruitful of steady Irish arrivals,
without much of great note occurring. A careful study of
the statistics of the first third of the nineteenth century, so far as
they are available, would doubtless be productive of good results.
By 1833 there were 40,000 Irish-born residents here, it was then
estimated. This growth had been gradual, but hardly remarked,
and certainly was not expected. This may well be realized when we
know that the graveyard in the rear of St. Peter’s Church answered
all the purposes of burial for the Irish Catholics at the outset, and,
until old St. Patrick’s site was bought from St. Peter’s Church in
1801, to serve for a general Catholic burial ground. It is also
worthy of note that no move for a larger cemetery was made until
1826, when the site of the present Cathedral was bought at a cost
of $5,500 for that purpose by the parishes of St. Peter’s, St. Patrick’s
and St. Mary’s, but was abandoned after a few years’ trial as being
too far out in the country. Of course, a tremendous tide of Irish
immigration set in after the famine years of 1846, 1847 and 1848.
But before that time, the period of the pioneers had ceased, and that
of construction had begun. It ended in New York with the arrival
of Bishop John Hughes. Under his masterful guidance the position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>of the Irish here completely changed; from the dwarfed and
apologetic attitude which many of his people had theretofore assumed,
they rose to man’s estate. He asserted their rights and made
them realize the justice of their appeal for fair treatment and decent
consideration. He courageously defended them from unjust
attack and took every possible occasion to announce the splendor
of their history and the value to American citizenship of their racial
characteristics. Impressing himself on the country, and finally winning
its confidence, he did more than any other one man has ever
done to make the Irish people an active, useful, aggressive force in
the community. He pointed out the way by which they have since
risen from poverty, misery and persecution—from an isolation worse
than the Ghetto—to a position so commanding as to seem almost
miraculous.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is an impression that Irish immigration is a matter of only
half a century. From this hasty sketch we have seen that it is a
matter of gradual growth, the earlier citizens being successful merchants,
adding to their capital, the later being the industrious, if
humble, whom necessity had driven abroad from a land which no
other force could have induced them to leave. Let us hope that
the inspiration of this Society may lead some one to undertake this
seemingly hopeless task of wresting from the past the record of those
who, today unknown, did the work whose fruits we are all enjoying.
All honor to the early exiles, whose very names are forgotten,
and yet who, hungry, exhausted from toil, hated and despised,
with their very heartstrings throbbing with the grief of a sensitive
race justly proud of its glorious traditions, then scorned and derided,—yet
in silence and resignation built deep and solid the foundations
of the free institutions of our country. Without these pioneers the
history of Irish genius and its accomplishments would have been the
less glorious, but without them there would have been as well a
different tale to write of this latest experiment in human freedom.
New York owes that race a particular debt of gratitude, which gave
to the State its first Governor, George Clinton, the son of a County
Longford emigrant, and his kinsman, DeWitt Clinton, the father of
the Erie Canal; which gave to the city its first mayor, James Duane,
an Irishman’s son; and which gave to the city fame as the scene of
the first successful attempt to conquer a way over the waters by the
use of steam, when the son of a Kilkenny man, Robert Fulton, saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the fruition of his dreams as the <em>Clermont</em> sailed the Hudson, August
11, 1807.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Irishmen and their sons have always been fond of the city which
to them symbolized the freedom and opportunity of the West. New
York has been the haven of their hopes. Here their eyes, still dim
with tears at the thought of Erin, first saw the glimmerings of hope
and confidence. She has honored and enriched their sons, and they
have not been ungrateful nor unworthy. From tens of thousands of
Irish hearts, when the hour for the closing of their earthly pilgrimage
was near at hand, has gone up an aspiration for her continued
prosperity who had not forgotten the stranger within her gates.
Many an Irishman has voiced the wish which Diedrich Knickerbocker
was represented as uttering as the expression of the Dutchman’s
love: ‘Haply this frail compound of dust, which while alive
may have given birth to nothing but unprofitable weeds, may form
a humble sod of the valley, whence may spring many a sweet wild
flower to adorn my beloved island of Mannahata!’”</p>

Maurice T. Moloney, Ex-Attorney General of the State of Illinois.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hon. Maurice T. Moloney:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<em>Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the American Irish Historical Society</em>:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The subject suggested for me to talk on, ‘The Pioneer Irish of
the West and Their Descendants,’ is one of great latitude, yet it is
one that has not been historically treated as it deserves. I hope,
however, in the short time I propose to devote to it, I will not fall
into the same line of thought as did one of Moore’s characters. In
the Veiled Prophet of Korassan, the great chamberlain, Fadladeen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>when about to criticise the young poet’s story, said: ‘In order to
convey with clearness my opinion of the story this young man has
related, it is necessary to take a review of all the stories that have
ever’—and when at this point he was interrupted by the good Princess,
he became mortified at not being allowed to show how much he
knew about everything but the subject immediately before him.
Bearing in mind, then, Fadladeen’s misadventure, still, we should
not be unmindful of our migration hither, and some of the causes
that led to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The successive misfortunes that have overtaken that unfortunate
people ever since Nicholas Brekespear gave a quit-claim deed of them
to Henry II constitute even in the blood-stained pages of English
history some of the greatest tragedies of ancient or modern times,
and should lead some at least of those good people who believe in
future rewards and punishments to consign that same Brekespear to a
warm abode.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is needless, no doubt, to tell Irishmen or their descendants,
or those interested in Irish history, of the many migrations from
that country. During the latter part of the seventeenth and the
first part of the eighteenth centuries, hundreds of thousands of them
filled the continental armies and many other thousands, young and
old, were banished to the West Indies and the colonies, as helots,
under the direction of that brutal, canting knave, Cromwell, and
others. I will call your attention, however, for a few moments only,
to some of the migrations of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I find on an examination of the Report of the Devon Commission
to Parliament in 1845, that in the decade from 1831 to 1841,
430,963 emigrants left Ireland. I further find from an examination
of Irish Immigration Statistics, that in the following decade from
1841 to 1851, 1,508,454 left the Island, and from 1851 to 1907,
4,130,015 persons emigrated from that unfortunate country, making
a total leaving the Island in seventy odd years of 6,069,432.
The present population of that country is about four and a half millions—a
little less. What a terrible indictment of England and her
seven centuries of oppression! No language that I am capable of
using could more eloquently depict her continued infamies than that
contained in these statistics.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, all of these people did not come to this country.
Some went to other countries, especially to the Antipodes, but the
great bulk of them came to the Great Republic, where many thousands
of their kith and kin had preceded them.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“It would be interesting as well as instructive to follow up and
trace the careers and fortunes of those Irish exiles and their descendants
who thronged the shores and trod the soil of the Republic.
It has never been done so far as I know. McGee, in the fifties, and
Maguire, in the sixties, each wrote a small volume on the subject,
and they are of some value to the student of history. Of this great
swarm, how many crossed the Alleghanies and steered their course
for the West? It is difficult to say. We have not even approximately
correct data on the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think, however, I am safe in saying that half of those who came
to this country within the last named period did so. In the Middle
West, in the great states of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and
Iowa,—indeed, in all the great western states—there is not a county,
city or village where they or their descendants are not to be found
in goodly numbers. Thank Heaven! race suicide has not as yet
overtaken them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maguire, in his work written in the sixties, advised his countrymen
to settle in the West, especially in the state of California. His
advice, no doubt, carried great weight and influenced many of
them in seeking Western homes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I remember, as a boy in Ireland, reading his lectures on the subject,
and subsequently, after graduating at the University of Virginia,
I determined to go to California, but straightened conditions
intervening, I was compelled to remain in Illinois. Hence, I am
fairly familiar with the people of that great State, and I think the
history of the Irish there would be fairly typical of them in other
Western States.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now I think I hear you ask—what of them? What have
they done, and what are they doing, in what many of you Eastern
gentlemen are pleased to call the ‘wild and woolly West.’ To be
frank, taking into consideration their old home conditions, and the
circumstances attending their coming, they are doing and have done
fairly well. They were mostly of the tenant farming class and day
laborers. Manufacturing in Ireland long prior to this time ceased to
be a factor, having been either abolished, or prevented by successive
English Parliaments. They were of necessity very poor, they and
their forebears for centuries having been plundered by heartless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>tyrants. No people prefer indigence and want to prosperity. It
was artificially enforced poverty that compelled them to emigrate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“On arriving in the West, therefore, they were for the most part
forced to occupy the hard lot of the unskilled laborer, and I may
say without fear of contradiction, what they undertook to do they
did well. They dug our great canals, built our great lines of railroads,
erected our telegraph lines from Chicago to San Francisco and
helped to operate them. They engaged in farming and stock raising
and have been successful in both. There is not a public utility
in the West whose physical structure at least does not owe its existence
in the main to Irish hands; and let it not be forgotten, too,
that gradually, as these men were able to put by a little of their
hard earnings, they tried to elevate themselves and their children in
the various walks of life. They did not rest content with their lot.
They knew their natural capabilities and tried to and did improve
them. Many of them, too, were men of initiative. Of course, the
rich and the learned, as a rule, were not among them. People of
that kind do not have to leave their country to seek homes in other
climes. Labor, however, manual or otherwise, is no disgrace; rather
is it a badge of respectability.</p>

      <div class='line'>Act well your part, there all the honor lies.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Of course many of them,—alas, too many,—fell by the way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As to the work done by our people in the West, take as an illustration
the Illinois &#38; Michigan Canal, which begins at Chicago
on the southern bend of Lake Michigan and enters the Illinois River
at La Salle, a distance of a hundred miles. From its inception to
its close the work was mainly done by Irish emigrants. It has been
to Illinois and the West a great benefit. Not only was this great
work done by the labor of Irishmen, but its successful accomplishment
in a financial way was due to the exertions of one of them.
In 1842 work on the canal had to be abandoned because of the financial
condition of the State Treasury. At that time the counties of
La Salle, Grundy and De Kalb constituted a Senatorial District, and
a young Irishman twenty-six years of age, one Michael Ryan, was
elected State Senator from there. He was, even at that early age,
easily the peer of any man in the West. So thoroughly did he master
the subject both as to the necessities of the canal and its resources
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>that he introduced and carried through the State Legislature, not
without opposition, however, a bill enabling the State to borrow one
million, six hundred thousand dollars, to complete the work. The
Governor at the time, recognizing his great ability, appointed him
and a Mr. Oakley agents for the State to proceed to London and
borrow that sum—no small amount for those days. They succeeded
in doing so. It is said of him (and there are those still living in
my home town who knew him well and speak of him with affection)
that he was a brilliant man, kind and courteous, an honest man.
To him did the State of Illinois mainly owe its success in raising
the means to complete that great undertaking.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Another leading Irishman in Illinois in those days was one William
Reddick, a State Senator for many years, a leading temperance
advocate, and a man of whom any people might be proud. He left
a large fortune to the city of Ottawa for library purposes. Many
of the younger emigrants learned trades and became skilled workmen.
Many of them engaged in the mercantile business, at the beginning
in a small way, but eventually became prosperous. So, too, did they
engage in manufacturing. Many of them owned coal mines and of
course many, very many, were miners. The Kilgubbin coal shaft,
as it was called, a valuable property in the county I reside in, was
owned and operated by one Nicholas Duncan, a Cork man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, of the hundreds of thousands of Irishmen who have
lived and still live with their descendants in the great city of
Chicago, it is not possible for me to give more than a passing
glance, and say that they are among the leading business men, lawyers,
doctors and financiers of that great metropolis. Volumes
might be written about them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There were not many professional men among those early emigrants.
There was one, however, who deserves special mention.
His name was E. G. Ryan. He was born in Dublin and came to
Illinois in the thirties. He practised law in that State and was
recognized at once as being among the leaders of the bar. He afterwards
moved to Wisconsin and there became Chief Justice of the
Court of Last Resort of that State. He was a profound lawyer, a
regular encyclopædia of learning. He was probably the greatest
jurist of the West, and there are those who say that he would bear
favorable comparison with the great John Marshall. He has been
dead for some few years.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“Very many of the descendants of those pioneers entered the different
professions. In law and medicine they easily hold their own
in the West. The ablest, all-around lawyer I ever met was Thomas
A. Moran of Chicago, for a time Judge of the Circuit and Appellate
Courts in that State. He, too, has passed out into the Great Beyond.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Another who made history might also be mentioned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In early days, as we say out West, one John H. Mulkey, then
about twenty years old, came to the southern part of the State of
Illinois from the State of Tennessee, as an itinerant Methodist
preacher. Being a man of good sense, he soon abandoned the ministry
and took up the study and afterwards the practice of the law.
He met with great success. He had a splendid career. He was elected
to the Supreme Court and served as an honored member of that body
for a number of years. In 1896, while I represented the State, he
came to my office (he was then practising law) and sought a continuance
of a case in the Supreme Court. I readily consented, and
he dictated to my stenographer the agreement for a continuance.
While he was doing so it occurred to me that he had a very peculiar
name indeed, and when he got through I said rather abruptly, I confess:
‘Judge, where in the world did you get that name? I can’t
think to what nation your ancestors could have belonged.’ He
looked at me, laughed, and said, ‘I am as Irish as you are, but an ancestor
changed the good old Irish name of Mulcahey to Mulkey,
and’ he added, ‘he didn’t improve it.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mulkey had a high sense of honor. He had a solicitous regard
for the reputation of his profession. He was a scholarly man, a
conscientious jurist. He detested a dishonest man and especially a
dishonest lawyer. Apropos of this, it may not be uninteresting if
I relate a few of the circumstances attending a dissenting opinion
which he wrote while on the Bench. It seems that two men, one
named Hughes and the other Appleton, were neighbors and both
practised law in Chicago. Hughes conveyed the title to a piece of
property worth eight to ten thousand dollars to Appleton, without
consideration. The latter was merely a trustee. Appleton disposed
of the property and converted the proceeds to his own use. The
Attorney-General of Illinois filed an information in the Supreme
Court setting up these facts and asking for the disbarment of Appleton.
On a final hearing that Court denied the application on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>ground that the relation of attorney and client did not exist between
them. Mulkey not being able to agree with the majority of the
Court wrote a unique dissenting opinion, in which among other
things, he said: ‘This defense so forcibly reminds me of the old
story of the profane bishop who had the good fortune to be a duke
also, I cannot refrain from telling it. An acquaintance who happened
to overhear him using profane language asked him how it was
that he, being a bishop, could be guilty of swearing. “Ah, my
friend,” replied his reverence, “I swear as a duke and not as a
bishop.” “But,” retorted the other, “when the devil comes to get
the duke, what will become of the bishop?” So, in this case, when
his Satanic Majesty calls for Appleton the trustee, I should like to
know what will become of Appleton the attorney.’ I might add that
some years after his admission to the bar, he became a Catholic,
and died in that faith.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder how many Irish names have been mutilated like that
of the good judge. I fear too many.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the management of railroads, our people have excelled in
the West. The children of two Irishmen, brothers, named Egan,
born within about thirty miles of where I reside, have been important,
if not chief factors in the management of many railroads.
They have been connected with the Grand Trunk, the Illinois Central
and other roads. I remember well, in 1894, when the great
strike, almost an incipient insurrection, occurred in Chicago, that
one of these Egans was selected by the officers and directors of all
the railroads centering in that great city, to take entire control of
their properties and manage them during the strike. This was quite
a tribute to the son of a poor Irishman. Another, still comparatively
young, might be mentioned. He was born in the town I
live in. I remember him as a poor boy, a brakeman on a branch
line running through our city. His name is Patrick Houlihan.
A brochure has been written on his career and is entitled, I believe,
‘From Water Carrier to General Manager.’ He has on different
lines, successively occupied the positions between that of water boy
and superintendent, and is now general manager of the Toledo,
St. Louis &#38; Western and the Chicago &#38; Alton Railroad Companies,
with headquarters at Chicago. He is bright and brainy, with years
of usefulness before him. He is a credit to our race.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In literature, we have fairly well held our own. I do not mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>to say that we have written as many novels, good bad and indifferent,
as others, but the Rileys, the Finnertys, the Sullivans, the
Clearys and Dunns, and men and women of such names have left
their impress upon our literature. Many of you no doubt have met
and all must have with pleasure, read that Western product, the
discoverer of Mr. Dooley and Archie Avenue road, that droll, inimitable
writer of ‘dialect’ a philosopher in his way—Finley Peter Dunn,
who like other good men, has recently gone wrong, in having against
the advice of Greeley and all the sages of the republic, migrated
backwards as it were until now Gotham claims him for her own.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now a few words as to the tillers of the soil.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Many of those emigrants settled upon the lands of the West,
though under disadvantageous circumstances. There are many
townships in my county, and in adjoining counties, and indeed scattered
all over the West, that have been settled almost exclusively by
them. Those lands are now worth on an average $150 per acre.
Measurably, this is true of the Middle West. It is literally true
of Illinois.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nebraska settlement, as it was called, embracing all that territory
from Kansas to Canada, and from the Missouri to the Rocky
Mountains, was thrown open for settlement in 1854. A large number
of Irish were among the early settlers. In 1857 a convention
was held in Buffalo to perfect plans for establishing Irish colonies
in the West. Delegates assembled from all over the country. Three
large colonies started as a result of this convention—one led by
Father Trecy founded St. Patrick’s Colony in Nebraska, now Jackson.
Another, under Father Powers, of Pennsylvania, went to
Missouri, and a third went to Minnesota. In the latter state, additional
Irish colonies have been established. They endured almost
untold trials and hardships in a new and wild country. Father
Trecy’s colony celebrated its Golden Jubilee in July, 1907, a dozen
of the original settlers being present. Greeley County, Nebraska,
is practically an Irish county, being settled almost exclusively by
Irishmen, especially is this true of the towns of Greeley Center,
O’Connor, Spalding and O’Neill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Instances of this kind might be indefinitely extended. Notwithstanding
this fact, we have been criticised for not going in larger
numbers upon the broad prairies and fertile lands of the West. I
admit the farmer’s life is the ideal one, but it took something more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>than hands and limbs and brains, too, to go upon a farm. It required
money even when land was cheapest. How could a family
in Ireland, turned out on the roadside by the crowbar brigade, who
with the greatest difficulty could scrape enough together to pay their
passage to America, be expected upon their arrival to purchase land
and agricultural implements, to go farming with? It was hardly
within the possibilities. Even if the father came alone, as he often
did, he was compelled to go to work on the first opportunity to provide
for his immediate wants and save something to send to the half-starving
family at home or pay the passage to America. And, if
it was a son or daughter who managed to come, they were ever striving
to send for one more of the family or likely enough, to send
the greater part of their hard earnings to pay the exorbitant rent
of the heartless landlord. I know whereof I speak. I am a living
witness of those happenings. As a boy, I was compelled to leave
the land of my birth, and I can say without affectation, that I never
experienced more real joy than I did when making my first remittance
to Ireland. Though I knew the ultimate destination of most
of it was the landlord’s pocket, still I think I had more pleasure
in sending than he had in receiving it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of the gold seekers of ’49 who rushed to the coast, many of
them were Irish. Many settled down in different parts of that
slope and as you know, many of them became millionaires. I need
only mention the names of Flood, O’Brien, Mackey, Phelan and
others, to conjure up visions of wealth. But, <i><span lang="fr">cui bono</span></i>. The richest
people are not always the most interesting even when the wealth
is honestly acquired, and here I may remark (though a little foreign
to the subject) if the wealth of many of our multi-millionaires
were tomorrow turned into the National Treasury, it would not begin
to compensate for the moral shame and degradation their practices
have brought on the republic. Kerosene colleges will never

sealed with their blood, their love of the republic. You all, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>doubt, have heard of a Sheridan, a Shields, a Corcoran, a Lawler,
and others of the West, who died that the Union might live. Ingratitude
has never been the failing of Irishmen. Gratitude for favors,
even small ones, adherence to principle, through good and evil
times, have ever been characteristic of the race. Prior to that war,
the hereditary enemy of our people despised America. Since its
termination, they have hated, but fear it. You know Gladstone,
when Jefferson Davis was inaugurated President, exclaimed that
a new nation had been born. We may in the future as we sometimes
have in the past, send de-natured Americans to London, but no occasional
slobbering over the great republic by perfidious Albion can
disguise that hatred. Napoleon said, scratch a Russian and you
will find a Tartar, scratch an Englishman or an Irishman of the
garrison, and almost invariably you will find a hater of America.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In conclusion, let me say, and I say it with some pride, but in
no boastful spirit, that the Irish people in the West, though having
to struggle from the lowest rung of the ladder, are physically, intellectually,
morally, and I might add, financially, the peers of their
neighbors. They are not a dying race. I wish some competent
hand would write their history.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Moloney’s address was greeted with much applause and
cheering, and at this point Senator Carter of Montana arrived in
the hall and was escorted to his place at the head table by the
Secretary-General and Mr. Moseley.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>President-General Quinlan</span>: “We are honored this evening by the presence of one of our most earnest members, whose distinguished services to his country in the United States Senate and earnest and unselfish devotion to the work of our Society endears him to all. It is with pleasure I introduce Hon. Thomas H. Carter, United States Senator from Montana.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Senator Carter</span>: “<em>Mr. Toastmaster, Fellow Members of the Society, Ladies and Gentlemen</em>: I am billed upon this program to deliver a ‘Capital Welcome.’ I at once disclaim ability to do that.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“‘Capital Welcome’ seems to imply a good or excellent welcome,
and that accomplishment is beyond me,—but I most cheerfully extend
to you a cordial welcome to this, the Capital City of our common
country, and I sincerely hope that as you each depart from here,
you will not feel impelled to write upon the register a sentiment
similar to that written by one of our distinguished fellow-countrymen
upon leaving a watering-place in England. Each of the party
was called upon to write on the register of the hostelry a sentiment,
and one bright member wrote these words: ‘I came here for change
and rest; the porter has the change, the landlord the rest.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“The man who wrote that was not the same man whom Brother
Lee desires me to tell about, who described the kind of a man that
Casey was. The man at the head of the table said ‘What kind of
a man is Casey?’ ‘Well,’ says Murphy, ‘I’ll tell you what kind of
a man Casey is. I went over to Casey’s house. Says he to me,
“Murphy, will you have a drink?” I says, “Of course I will, Mr.
Casey.” He says, “Murphy, shall I pour or will you pour?”
“Pour yourself,” says I, “Mr. Casey.” He says, “All right, tell
me when to stop.” He poured out a drop or two, and out of politeness
I said “Stop, Casey,” and Casey stopped. That’s the kind
of a man Casey is.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“This Society needs no welcome to the Capitol City of this nation.
Wheresoever you may turn in viewing our parks or avenues or historic
halls, you will see in bronze and in marble mute evidences of
the appreciation expressed by a grateful people of the achievements
and contributions of the Irish and the Irish Americans, in building
up and maintaining this great Republic.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In LaFayette Square, immediately in front of the White House,
is a statue of Andrew Jackson, a renowned President of the United
States who was the son of an Irishman. Out in the northwest part
of the city, but a few days ago, we assembled to unveil an equestrian
statue to a man whom General Grant pronounced the greatest
soldier of any time, the son of an Irishman, Philip Sheridan. Come
down but a little farther and you will find a square adorned with
trees and flowers, and in its center a beautiful statue to Admiral
Farragut, of Irish blood on his mother’s side. Over in Iowa circle,
to the northeast of this point, is the statue of General John A.
Logan, the son of an Irishman. Pennsylvania Avenue has been
gazed upon for years and years by the sightless eyes of a bronze
statue of General John A. Rawlins, the confidential friend of the
peerless victor of Appomattox. General Rawlins was of Irish extraction.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Across Pennsylvania Avenue from this hotel is a great building
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>in which throbs the heart of the mighty postal system of the country
for which we will expend two hundred and thirty millions of dollars
during this fiscal year. The first Postmaster-General admitted
to the Cabinet of a President was John Barry, the son of an Irishman.
And that reminds me of the way Cabinet officers are selected.
It is generally supposed that the President’s Cabinet is organized
in conformity with law, but such is not the fact. One day
Postmaster Barry received a note reading thus: ‘Tomorrow and
hereafter you will attend Cabinet meetings.’ Signed ‘Andrew Jackson.’
It was that which established the custom of calling in the
Postmaster-General as one of the counselors of the President of the
United States, and that custom has been maintained to this day.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go through the hall of statuary in our Capitol, and there you
will find in marble men of proud fame in this country’s history—General
Louis Cass, Henry Wilson, General Shields and others,
making a long roll of men of Irish birth or lineage which I will
not undertake to call here tonight.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just across the Potomac River, when the life of the nation was
assailed, Colonel Corcoran of New York was the first to move forward
with the Stars and Stripes. When the Capitol was menaced
from the southwest, ‘Phil’ Sheridan was there with his cavalry to
meet the enemy. When the fate of the nation was trembling in the
balance upon the historic field of Gettysburg, the Union Army was
directed by the masterful mind of General Meade of Irish blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will not go back to the early days of the country’s history.
It is sufficient to say that in a parliamentary inquiry as to the conduct
of the war against the colonies by a committee of the House
of Commons of which Edmund Burke was a member, this interesting
fact was brought forth. In the cross-examination of Major
General Robertson, Mr. Burke asked the question, ‘Of what elements
is the Continental Army composed?’ Robertson said, ‘On authority
of General Lee, I inform you that more than half the Continental
Army is made up of Irishmen.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“The illustrious names that adorn our country’s history are entitled
to imperishable renown because of great deeds well done in
that Revolutionary struggle. Among them is a list of men of Irish
birth, beginning with the man who struck the first blow, General
Sullivan, and continuing along the line to the close of the war. And
when I think of the contributions made, the common sufferings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>endured, and the sacrifices made without limit as to time or circumstance,
I say the Irish and their descendants are entitled to the privilege
of claiming with proud confidence that this is their own country.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The history of Ireland is confined to an island with its curious,
sad and heroic circumstances, but the history of the Irish people
is limited only by the inhabitable portions of the globe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have been, as you have been, chagrined to perceive the disposition
to rob these people of the credit which is truly and justly
their due. Who can read of Burke and Goldsmith and Johnson
and Sheridan and Tyndale as English authors without a feeling that
some one has been guilty of grand larceny and misrepresentation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who can read the page of history which places Arthur Wellesley
as an Englishman without feeling that the hero of Waterloo
has been misplaced? Why deny to this island, bereft of the right
to control its own destiny, the privilege of claiming the honor and
distinction properly due to the achievements of its distinguished
sons?</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is desirable that a society like unto this should be established
in England to change the trend which leads to error and confusion.
What we undertake here should be undertaken there. I am glad
that this Society has taken up the work of developing the history
of the Irish and their descendants in the United States, for it is
a great and glorious feature in American history. While proud of
the past, while proud of the achievements of those whose deeds we
record, it is important, I think, that we should at the same time
bear in mind the duty we owe to the future.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I would that the Americans of Irish birth and descent in this
country could unite their energies and make of this force in American
life a leading force for higher conceptions of civic duty, a
force looking to better living, a force working for a civilization
such as has not been dreamed of by those who have struggled in
the past. This we may do while recording that which has gone
by with fidelity and truth. Let us be true to ourselves by working
for such conditions as will make our race more distinguished henceforth
in its achievements than it has been in the splendid work of
the past.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span><span class='sc'>President-General Quinlan</span>: The next and last toast of the evening is “Advantages of Historical Research to Irish Americans.” The response will be made by a noble American of Irish ancestry, who comes from the granary belt of the great Northwest, the land of Sitting Bull and the brave Sioux, where the ardent flames of patriotism burn with the intensity of true Americanism.</p>

<p class='c008'>I take great pleasure in introducing to you, ladies and gentlemen,
Hon. Robert J. Gamble, United States Senator from South Dakota.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Senator Gamble</span>: <em>Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen</em>: I accept the kindly and humorous felicitations of your President. I admit I hail from South Dakota, once the land of the Sioux, of Red Cloud and Sitting Bull. In these later years, however, it has been transformed with marvelous rapidity into an empire of wealth, of productiveness, of social and civic development, and with ideals
at least equal to those of any in the Sisterhood of States. In her
wonderful prosperity she has been as jealous of the one as the other.
In her Constitution and in her laws she has sought to make liberty
secure, to foster and provide for the education of her children, to
encourage the highest ideals of citizenship, to inspire a patriotism
worthy of the opportunities of her people. Along all of these lines
we feel South Dakota has met with a high degree of success. She
stands almost the lowest in the percentage of illiteracy of her population.
Pauperism is scarcely observable. Wealth and comfort are
very generally diffused amongst her people. Her schools and colleges
are equal to the necessities of the state. The door of opportunity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>is open to all. For more than a decade she has produced
each year more wealth per capita than any other state in the Union.
(Applause.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. President, at this late hour I give you assurance of brevity
in what I have to say. I appreciate very much the compliment of
your invitation, and indeed it is a great pleasure to be present on this
occasion and to respond to the toast to which I have been assigned.</p>

<p class='c008'>The history of Ireland in itself is a sad one, but the high purpose
and invincible courage of her manhood and her womanhood,
their high ideals and devotion to liberty and to national integrity,
have been fraught with blessings and have brought encouragement
to human liberty the world over. (Applause.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Within the circumscribed limits of their own nationality success
rarely crowned the patriotic efforts and heroic struggle for liberty
of the Irish people. Their field of activity, however, has not been
confined to the land of their birth, and has been limited only wherever
humanity has asserted itself against tyranny and in a struggle
for better conditions and for orderly liberty.</p>

<p class='c008'>America owes a wonderful debt of gratitude to the Irish race.
We must recognize that preceding American independence there was
a strong element of our population composed of Irish Americans.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the strongest advocates for American independence were
Irishmen, or the descendants of Irishmen. Hancock and Rutledge
and the Carrolls and their co-workers contributed vastly to the
development of a National spirit. The work of these strong, patriotic
and efficient men had much to do with drawing the colonies together
in united effort and cementing their interests in the common
cause. Their voices had long been raised in protest against the
Mother Country before the musketry was heard at Lexington. These
brave and courageous men, and their associates, with their large vision
and patriotic purpose, pointed out the way and crystalized the
sentiment for national independence. The work they performed for
the cause of national independence, though different in character,
was as important in its way as that of the actual participants in the
field, of the general or the soldier.</p>

<p class='c008'>As indicative of the high character of the Irish race, and of
their activities and large influence in the formative period of our
National history it is gratifying and with a sense of pride in this
presence to state that in the First Continental Congress, with a membership
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>of fifty-four, eleven were Irish or of Irish descent. The
same race has also to its credit three presidents of the Republic
whose ancestors came from the Emerald Isle. And Roosevelt, an
honored member of this Society, not only our President, but the most
distinguished citizen of the world, takes pride in the fact that he
can trace his lineage to this indomitable people. (Applause.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Of the membership of the Continental Congress that put forth
the immortal Declaration of Independence, twenty per cent was Irish
or of Irish descent. The hand of Thompson that first transcribed
it upon parchment was Irish; the first signature that was placed to
it as President was that of John Hancock, an Irishman-American;
and when those immortal words were read for the first time to the
assembled multitude from the balcony of Continental Hall at Philadelphia,
it was by the voice of an Irishman, Mr. Nixon; and when
it was placed in type for the first time it was by one Dunlap, an
Irish printer.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the spring of 1777, when Congress appointed eighteen brigadier-generals,
six of those who were thus commissioned were Irish
by birth or descent. Among the number were the dashing and brilliant
Mad Anthony Wayne and the strong and courageous Clinton.
I need only speak of the accomplished Montgomery, whose valor
has been justly praised and who died a hero’s death upon the plains
of Quebec, or of Sullivan, the splendid leader and the associate of
Washington, upon whom the latter leaned more than upon any other,
and for whose great service the thanks of Congress were extended;
of Knox and Stark and many others who were ideal and successful
leaders in the great Revolutionary struggle. It has been asserted,
but undoubtedly with very much exaggeration, that half of the
Continental Army were Irish or of Irish descent. Even if this be
not true it must be admitted that the race had a large representation
in the Army, and it speaks well for their patriotism and devotion to
the cause of American Independence.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Irish race I think can take a just pride in the accomplishments
of its people, not only as statesmen and leaders in contributing
vastly towards shaping the policies of the colonies in the formative
period of our history with a view to the ultimate forming of the
Federal Union, and also in leadership and on men in the field of
battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it was not alone upon the land that the heroism of the race
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>asserted itself in the cause for National Independence. If not the
first, at least among the first naval fights of the Revolution was the
capture of the British ship <em>Margaretta</em> at Machias Bay on the Coast
of Maine on May 11, 1775. The Americans were commanded by
Captain O’Brien, the son of an Irish immigrant. This victory has
frequently been called “The Lexington of the Seas.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was John Barry, a native of Ireland, who received one of the
first naval commissions from Congress. Through his ability and
leadership and his many well earned victories he brought the highest
credit to America upon the seas. Commodore Barry today is justly
called “The Father of the American Navy.” He was the great
naval commander of the Revolution. I might name many other
distinguished officers of this nationality who rendered conspicuous
service to their country and added to the fame of the Navy in the
war of the Revolution.</p>

<p class='c008'>Irish womanhood also gave evidence of its devotion and heroism
in the person of Mollie Pitcher, who took the place at the cannon
of her fallen husband and is accorded a hero’s place in the battle
of Monmouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The devotion of those of Irish blood did not exhaust itself in the
cause of the Revolution alone. In the War of 1812 it contributed
some of its most conspicuous figures. It was Jackson at New Orleans,
Commodore Stewart on the sea with his <em>Constitution</em>, McDonough
on Lake Champlain and Perry on Lake Erie that won imperishable
glory for the American Army and Navy in that War.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the war with Mexico the men of this race had representatives
in the persons of Generals Kearney and Shields. The latter also
received the exceptional distinction of having been elected to a
seat in the United States Senate on three different occasions in
separate elections from three different states.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the recent war, among the most illustrious names is that of
General Sheridan, the son of an Irishman, and although less conspicuous
others of the same blood rendered high service to their
country, and amongst them are such honored names as Meade, Logan,
Meagher, Mulligan, Shields and Corcoran.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is no idle boast to assert that the names of the men of Irish
blood adorn the most conspicuous pages of the history of the Republic.
They aided as wise, safe and patriotic counsellors in laying
the foundations of our institutions. They fought with heroism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>and devotion in the struggle for independence, both upon the land
and upon the sea. In every trial and test that has come to us in
our history they have made willing and great sacrifice to defend the
honor of their country and to perpetuate and sustain her institutions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ireland has contributed much to the Republic. In a high degree
the race has been unselfish. The devotion of the race has not alone
been confined to the United States. It has been frequently and
truthfully said though not always gratefully and freely admitted that
she gave a Wellington to England and in these later years she has
also contributed a Wolsey, a Roberts and a Kitchener. To France
she gave McMahon, and to Spain an O’Donnell.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of her brave and devoted men followed Bolivar in South
America and aided materially in laying the foundations of the Republic
in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p class='c008'>On every field of human endeavor the Irish name has a conspicuous
place. In statesmanship she has given Burke, who enriched
our language with his oratory. She supplied also Phillips,
Grattan and O’Connell.</p>

<p class='c008'>In literature she has been most generous in giving to the world
Goldsmith, Moore, Collins, Knowles, Sheridan and a host of others.
In the sciences she has contributed Lardner, Rowe, Proctor,
Tyndall, Faraday and our own Fulton.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor has she been lacking in the field of Art, but America adopted
as her own the gifted St. Gaudens. In philosophy and theology
she has many distinguished names.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. President, in conclusion I would state I believe “The advantages
of Historical research to Irish Americans” will give them a
more just appreciation of the Irish character, of the services they
have rendered in founding, sustaining and perpetuating our institutions
and in maintaining the highest ideals of our common country.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>President-General Quinlan</span>: One final word. The Secretary-General wishes to say something, and I know it will interest you all.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Secretary-General Lee</span>: Mr. Chairman, I move you that the thanks of the American Irish Historical Society be tendered the speakers of the evening for their excellent services in our behalf, and that the entire address of each be printed in the Journal.</p>

<p class='c012'>Motion carried by unanimous vote.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span><span class='sc'>Secretary-General Lee</span>: Mr. Chairman, I move you that the thanks of the Society and its invited guests are justly due and are hereby tendered Mr. Thomas J. Talty, Manager of the Hotel Raleigh, for his careful personal attention to the banquet and its details, and for his uniform courtesy to members and guests.</p>

<p class='c012'>Motion carried by unanimous vote.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Secretary-General Lee</span>: Mr. Chairman, I move you that the thanks of the Society be tendered to our fellow-member, Mr. Henry L.

<p class='c012'>Motion carried by unanimous vote.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>President-General Quinlan</span>: This ends the proceedings of the Eleventh Annual Banquet of the Society. I thank you one and all for your attendance. The next annual dinner will take place in the city of New York, and we hope you will all be with us there and that the attendance will be even greater than tonight.</p>

<p class='c011'>The entire proceedings of the Reception by President Roosevelt,
Annual Meeting and Eleventh Annual Dinner were stenographically
reported by Miss Viola Follis of Providence, R. I., and by her
transcribed. Within a few days afterwards, a copy of his speech
was furnished each speaker, so that it would come to the hands of
the Editor of the <cite>Journal</cite> exactly as the speaker wished it finally to
read.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stenographic report and transcription were absolutely complete
and without error.</p>

<p class='c008'>The floral decorations on the tables and walls were beautiful
and lavish, and at the termination of the dinner some of the nice
pieces were sent to the quarters of our lady guests, while the remainder
were sent to the hospitals.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the evening music was furnished by a good orchestra.
The words of “Star Spangled Banner,” “Columbia, the Gem of the
Ocean,” “Wearing of the Green,” “Minstrel Boy,” and “Yankee
Doodle” were printed on the program, and the assemblage, accompanied
by the musicians, sung these songs with a will.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>A large number of guests left Washington Sunday, January 17th,
on the Royal Blue Line 3 p. m. express for New York, and for
their comfort special cars were attached exclusively for their use.
In the dining car a special dinner was prepared and served under
the supervision of Conductor Lewis A. Herring, which was enjoyed
by nearly all who returned on that train, and he made the occasion
enjoyable by pointing out several interesting bits of scenery <em>en route</em>,
among which was the place where Washington crossed the Delaware.

<p class='c026'><span class='sc'>Honorary State Regent for Rhode Island, National Society

an Original Member of the Rhode Island Society of the
Cincinnati—a Man of Irish Parentage.</span></p>

<p class='c027'>Who that visits Italy can fail to be inspired by the ruins of the Forum and the palaces of the Cæsars on the Palatine? The Italian Government has done wisely in making its work of excavation a work also of restoration by replacing as far as possible the statues and monuments of ancient time in their original positions, and in entrusting visitors to the care of guides educated for their duties by
a university course in the history and archæology of the Eternal City.
Such a guide, after a whole day spent in enthusiastic descriptions of
the temples, public buildings, rostra and tombs of the Forum, was
asked, “How happens it that you are so very enthusiastic over all
this, when it is your duty to make this round day after day?”
Never will the hearer forget his reply as, drawing himself up to his
full height, he exclaimed with the proudest, loftiest accent, “<em>I am
a Roman</em>.”</p>

<p class='c026'>“The grandeur that was Rome” was the spirit of her citizens,
their expression in the life of their city, of their high ideals. When
these ideals failed to inspire, Rome fell.</p>

<p class='c026'>That which makes a State is the character of its citizens. One of
the strongest influences in the moulding of character is the example
of the heroes of the past. Preservation of the history of those who
helped to make and mould the nation is, therefore, essential to the
maintenance of patriotism. Indeed, it is essential to the true moral
development of the nation,—to the very preservation of the nation.</p>

<p class='c026'>One great advantage of the memorial tablet and the statue over the
printed page is that the former are seen and understood by all, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the pages of history are only turned by those who have a certain degree
of education and interest. “What mean ye by these stones?”
the children in the land of Canaan would ask, gazing upon the heap
of twelve smooth stones by the banks of the Jordan. Then would
the fathers in Israel reply, “Because the waters of Jordan were cut
off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and these stones
from the bed of the river are for a memorial forever of Jehovah’s
leadership of his people through the dry bed of the river into the
promised land.”</p>

<p class='c026'>The historical and patriotic societies of the United States are
doing a much needed work by the erection of tablets and the marking
of historic spots. A want of reverence for those who founded
our nation and fought to establish it; a carelessness as to the lessons
to be learned from the early history of the country; a desecration
of places consecrated by the blood of our heroes, had much to
do with making us, in appearance, a flippant, boastful people, glorying
only in the “bigness” of our country and what our own generation
was doing, in short, the boastful Yankee caricatured by our
European kinsmen.</p>

<p class='c026'>That temper has changed. While the greater seriousness with
which the American people undertake their problems of government
is no doubt in part due to territorial expansion and greater international
relations, credit must also be given to the impressive influence
of the memorials placed in our State houses, our parks, along
our streets, commemorating the worthy deeds of our ancestors.</p>

<p class='c026'>It is then a direct benefit to the State, and aid to good government,
and to the realization of the highest civic ideals, to place,
where all can see, memorials reciting the virtues and the heroic
deeds of men like Washington, Lincoln, Greene, Sullivan, Sherman
and a host of others whose splendid achievements, in war and in
peace, are a part of our heritage as American citizens, and are the
inspiration of our youth to give also of their best, in talents and
in loyal, patriotic effort; to make our country great in the best
sense,—great in the character of its citizens, great in the accomplishment
of high ideals; great in the enjoyment by all of the blessings
of liberty.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CARTER DAY NURSERY. GIFT BY MR. PATRICK CARTER, MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL, IN HONOR OF DECEASED SON.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c028'><span class='sc'>Ceremony Takes Place at Handsome Building, Corner Pine
and Byron Streets, in Presence of Clergy, Prominent
Business Men and Representatives of Religious Denominations.</span></p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c029'>
    <div>BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c030'>In the presence of members of the clergy, prominent business men and representatives of various religious denominations, the new Day Nursery, erected at Pine and Byron streets as a memorial to Edward A. Carter, by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Carter, was formally transferred to Bishop Matthew Harkins at 11 o’clock yesterday morning. Previous to this ceremony there was a low Mass, at which
Bishop Harkins was the celebrant, Rev. Austin Dowling, also a
member of the American Irish Historical Society, acting as his assistant,
at which time the building was blessed.</p>

<p class='c030'>A large audience assembled in the hall on the second floor to witness
the transfer of the keys, the deed and other documents to the
Bishop. It numbered men and women prominent in the business
and social life of the city, as well as others interested in charitable
work.</p>

<p class='c030'>After Bishop Harkins, wearing the purple robes of his office, had
taken a seat on the stage, with Fr. Dowling on his right and Rev.
William Pyne on his left, Mr. Carter made the following speech in
presenting the structure to the Bishop:</p>

<h4 class='c031'>MR. CARTER’S ADDRESS.</h4>

<p class='c032'>“Bishop Harkins: In my own name and that of Mrs. Carter I
have great pleasure in handing over to you this morning, as the representative
of Nazareth home and the head of the diocese of Providence,
the keys of the Edward A. Carter Memorial, the receipted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>bills for its cost and a paid-up five years’ policy of insurance on the
building for $15,000.</p>

<p class='c030'>“I am sure it is a happy moment for Mrs. Carter and for me;
I may say, the proudest moment of our lives, to be in a position to
commemorate in this way our son who gave such promise in his youth,
and who was taken from us so suddenly.</p>

<p class='c030'>“A little more than a year ago we laid him away in St. Francis
Cemetery and with him the hopes that we had built upon, but the
money which would have been his to invest in business had he lived
we have resolved to lay aside for his memory in another kind of investment.</p>

<p class='c030'>“This is our only stipulation—that it be administered prudently,
scientifically, but with mercy and in the spirit of Christian charity.</p>

<p class='c030'>“We have no fear, Bishop, that the money which we have given
to the Nazareth Home will ever be diverted from the purpose for
which we intend it. We require no bonds from you, for your high
standing makes the ordinary safeguard of business in this case unnecessary.
Into whatever hands you entrust it, we feel certain that
they will execute what we plan.</p>

<p class='c030'>“You, ladies of the Queen’s Daughters, honor us with your presence
here today. You have presided at the formation of this work;
your ideas are here incorporated and you have pledged yourselves to
its support; therefore, may I be the first to welcome you to its hospitality.</p>

<p class='c030'>“Let me then, Bishop Harkins, in closing, hand over to you these
evidences that the building so happily completed is entirely unencumbered;
and let me assure you that while in doing so I now resign
the responsibility which has been my preoccupation and pleasure for
several months, still, while either Mrs. Carter or myself live, our
hearts are in this building, both for the name it bears and for the
work which we have confidence it will never fail to do in our community.”</p>

<h4 class='c031'>RESPONSE OF BISHOP.</h4>

<p class='c032'>In response Bishop Harkins said in part: “Mr. and Mrs. Carter,
I receive very willingly and gratefully these evidences of your
generosity. I express to you my thanks and those of the entire community.
There may have been other cases in the United States like
this, but this is the first case that has come to my knowledge where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>a memorial of this kind has been reared to an apparently lost, but
not really lost, son.</p>

<p class='c030'>“This is a very special, a very peculiar case. It shows not only
a very strong affection, but a very lively faith. It is that faith that
is necessary, a faith in the future, a realization that death does not
end all.</p>

<p class='c030'>“Your son was a Cathedral boy, and when I say that I speak with
a considerable degree of pride. He was one of us and we knew
him and loved him. You determined that he should live on in a
certain way and live just about where he lived when he was here.
So you have made your boy to live; you have given him a kind of
earthly immortality, if I may use that term.</p>

<p class='c030'>“He will live in the persons of the poor children who will be
cared for here. They will have the uplifting influence of the good
sisters, the Queen’s Daughters, the clergy, and all who can help them
in any way. Yet it will be he who will be living here.</p>

<p class='c030'>“I thank you in my own name and in the name of the diocese of
Providence. I am sure that all those here present agree that no better
example can be given a community than that given here today.
There is gratitude in the hearts of all the citizens of Providence for
this gift.</p>

<p class='c030'>“In the name of the sisters who will have charge of this institution,
I wish to thank you. I welcomed them to our city here in
Providence, for I knew that I could not do greater service than to
bring here the wise and careful administration of charitable work
they have always shown. They will be mothers to the children.
They will try to give, and will well-nigh succeed in giving, all the
maternal love that is given children in the most favored homes.
They will train them not only in their duties to the church, but in
every duty they must perform in civil life.”</p>

<p class='c030'>In conclusion Bishop Harkins paid a tribute to the Queen’s
Daughters, the organization which has assumed the maintenance of
the institution.</p>

<h4 class='c031'>DONORS ARE HONORED.</h4>

<p class='c032'>After the Bishop’s address, Miss Mary A. McArdle, President of
the Queen’s Daughters, made a brief address, in which she stated
that Mr. and Mrs. Carter had been elected honorary members of
the Daughters of the Queen of Heaven, concluding by presenting to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Mrs. Carter a bouquet of roses, in number the same as the years of
life of the son in whose memory the structure was given.</p>

<p class='c030'>Mr. Carter responded briefly and the visitors then inspected the
building, many registering in the book provided for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c030'>Among those present were: Mgr. Thomas F. Doran, Vicar General
of the diocese; Rev. Owen F. Clarke, Rev. Edward E. Seagrave,
Rev. D. F. Lowney, Rev. James C. Walsh, Rev. M. J.
McCabe, Mayor P. J. McCarthy, Mayor-elect Henry Fletcher, Attorney-General
William B. Greenough, Assistant Attorney-General
Harry P. Cross, Cyrus P. Brown, Col. Cyrus M. Van Slyck, Judge
Frank E. Fitzsimmons, Judge Thomas Z. Lee, John E. Canning and
Thomas F. Monahan.</p>

<h4 class='c031'>MODEL INSTITUTION.</h4>

<p class='c032'>This nursery, said to be one of the finest institutions of its kind
in the country, has been erected for the accommodation of poor children,
regardless of race, creed or color. The Queen’s Daughters,
a body of Catholic women with a membership of 700, which was organized
in January of the present year for the performance of charitable
works, has assumed its maintenance. The organization is affiliated
with the Queen’s Daughters of St. Louis, formed in 1889 by
thirty-two women of that city for charitable purposes.</p>

<p class='c030'>The Sisters of the Holy Ghost, also known as the White Sisters,
to whom the institution was donated, first came to work among the
sick poor in this city in September, 1907. In their errands of mercy
they found that a day nursery was very much needed in the section
in which their home is located. The two day nurseries already established
have been unable to take care of all the children, both having
long waiting lists, and the building blessed yesterday will relieve
the situation to a considerable degree.</p>

<p class='c030'>The building is admirably arranged, the purpose for which it will
be used having been taken into careful consideration by the architects,
Stone, Carpenter &#38; Sheldon, and the ideas of the architects
being faithfully carried out by the builder, M. J. Houlihan.</p>

</div>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Mr. Carter’s intelligent liberality has rendered possible in Providence
a charity of peculiar value. The handsome building is a better
monument to his son’s memory than the most costly sarcophagus
would be. It bids fair for many years to come to minister to the
needs of great numbers of children of tender age whose parents cannot
care for them during the working hours of the day; and the
community would have double reason to congratulate itself if the
example set by these donors were to inspire other citizens of Providence
to similar generous gifts. There are twenty-three thousand
women in this city who are employed in gainful occupations, and
many of them are married, with small children to provide for. It
is difficult to think of a more useful institution than one that helps
to lighten the domestic anxieties of these workers during their enforced
absence from home.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>WAR RECORD OF COLONEL JAMES QUINLAN.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c033'>
    <div><span class='sc'>One of the Earliest Members of the American Irish Historical Society.</span></div>
    <div class='c003'>BY FRANCIS J. QUINLAN, M. D., L. L. D., PRESIDENT-GENERAL.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>In Volume VI of the Journal appeared a short sketch of Colonel Quinlan’s life, in which his military record was incomplete and the date of birth and receipt of certain commissions were incorrectly stated. The data having been carefully collected and verified, a revised sketch is hereby submitted:</p>

<p class='c030'>James Quinlan was born in Tipperary, Ireland, September 13,
1833, and came to New York in 1850 and there studied engineering.
In 1853 he joined the National Guard and became a member of the
Sixty-Ninth Regiment, being commissioned a Lieutenant in 1855,
under Charles S. Roe, and commissioned Captain in 1856.</p>

<p class='c030'>On April 23, 1861, a few days after the fall of Fort Sumter, he
left New York with the Sixty-Ninth as Captain of Engineers. He
was present at the battle of Blackburn’s Ford, July 18th, and Bull
Run July 21st, where he was severely wounded. After this battle
Acting Brigadier-General T. F. Meagher recruited the celebrated
Irish Brigade, and he was commissioned Major of the Eighty-Eighth
New York Infantry, one of the regiments of that organization, in
1861, and ordered by General Meagher to proceed to Fort Schuyler
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>and take command there until further orders. (As far as we know,
he was the first volunteer officer to take command of a Fort in the
Civil War.) He was present in all the battles of that famous
Brigade in the Peninsular Campaign and commanded the regiment
all through the Seven Days’ fighting. He won his Medal of Honor
by leading a charge on a Confederate battery at Savage Station, Va.,
June 29, 1862. The battery in question was one of six guns, and
had been very annoying to the Union troops. Several other regiments
had made efforts to silence it, but without avail. General W.
W. Burns, U. S. A., who was in command on that memorable day,
wrote at the time Major Quinlan received his Medal of Honor as
follows: “The Medal of Honor won by your gallant charge which
silenced the enemy’s battery at Savage Station and closed that desperate
attack upon the rear of the Army of the Potomac, June 29,
1862, is a just reward and memento for conspicuous bravery due
from a grateful Republic to the brave leader of the gallant Eighty-Eighth
New York. No one can feel more satisfaction for this signal
proof of distinction and glory than your old Commander of that
day. The Eighty-Eighth saved the lives of many gallant soldiers
by that forlorn-hope charge, and cleared our way to victory that
day. It commemorated the charge of the Irish Brigade at Fontenoy.”
In the Circular “Medals of Honor” issued by the War Department
October 31, 1897, the ground of award of Major Quinlan’s medal is
as follows: “Led his regiment on the enemy’s battery, silenced the
guns, held the position against overwhelming numbers, and covered
the retreat of the Second Army Corps.” He was honorably mentioned
by General McClellan for bravery at Malvern Hill and Antietam.
He was commissioned Lieutenant-Colonel on September 22,
1862, and received his honorable discharge for disability on medical
certificate February 4, 1863.</p>

<p class='c030'>After a few weeks’ illness of heart trouble he died at his home,
104 East 96th Street, August 29, 1906.</p>

<p class='c030'>And so has passed into history the name of a citizen of foreign
birth, who owed allegiance to the whole of his adopted country, and
when her troubles came he was found early at the front, dedicating
his all to her perpetuity.</p>

<p class='c030'>A firm, honest friend, a devoted Christian, a loyal brave soldier
went to his rest when James Quinlan joined the soldiers of our great
Republic who had gone before.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>JOSEPH O’CONNOR, EDITOR, AUTHOR AND POET, WHO DECEASED AT ROCHESTER, N. Y., OCTOBER 9TH, 1908.</h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c031'><span class='sc'>Sketch of His Life. One of His Favorite Poems.</span></h4>

<p class='c032'>A great editor laid down forever a brilliant, beautiful and useful pen when Joseph O’Connor, the Rochesterian, passed into Eternity from his home in Rochester on the night of October 9, 1908.</p>

<p class='c030'>In a few hours the news had flashed to all points of the compass,
bringing a pause and a hush of sadness to thousands of homes, from
Maine to California, wherein his unique personality was known and
loved through his nearly forty years of journalistic leadership.</p>

<p class='c030'>Born in New York State of Irish parents in 1841, he was educated
in the best schools of his native State for the practice of the law, but
he early chose journalism instead of law for his life work and he
made a magnificent success of it.</p>

<p class='c030'>He brought to the work a mind well-stocked with more of the true
history of the world than falls to the lot of most students of history.
He brought to his work a mind imbued with the true Christian
philosophy of the Catholic catechism. He had formed from
youth up a habit of broad, kindly outlook on things in general. He
assumed and maintained a manly attitude in politics, uncompromising
in principle, but tolerant of other men’s opinions. He had a born
poet’s appreciation of true poetry, and a literary judgment that came
to be universally respected. He had a gift of expression as a model
of unique, finished, sincere writing. And his humility was the best
of it all.</p>

<p class='c030'>He won his readers to his way of seeing things as much by the
very apparent unconsciousness of his own superiority as by his logical
presentation of his subject.</p>

<p class='c030'>Through all his long life of varied editorship and many degrees
of political and literary success, there is no pessimism charged to
his account, no animosity, no bitterness; not even discourtesy.</p>

<p class='c030'>Many a time in the heat of a political campaign he had to strike
at a champion of the other side, but his blow was always leonine.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>It was a settler of the subject in dispute, but it left no ugly memories—no
galling personalities ever marred his political battles.</p>

<p class='c030'>He scored his successes by the friendly hand shakes of his worsted
antagonists.</p>

<p class='c030'>He prized his independence in politics, and never jeopardized it
by accepting favors or honors from friend or foe.</p>

<p class='c030'>With one or two exceptions, every change that he made in his position
was due to his insistent desire to maintain his personal independence
as a writer. He left the <cite>Indianapolis Sentinel</cite> because
he did not wish to conform to its political policy. His editorial
work on the <cite>New York World</cite> became irksome on this same account.
He broke with the managers of the <cite>Buffalo Courier</cite> in 1886
because he disliked Grover Cleveland and because he did not propose
to stultify his editorial utterances in a newspaper whose proprietor
was specially friendly at the time to the Buffalo President.
He is said to have refused a flattering offer from Charles A. Dana to
become editorial writer on the <cite>New York Sun</cite> because he did not
believe he could conform to Mr. Dana’s ideas, however much he
might admire the genius of that brilliant editor.</p>

<p class='c030'>He set his editorial chair on a calm high level and from it addressed
daily a clientele that loyally followed him in all his journeyings
through fields of philosophy, history, poetry, romance and even
the common things of everyday life. To read him once was to
seek him again and remain his disciple.</p>

<p class='c030'>He might have made his fame rest on his poetry, but he subordinated
that gift to his passion for regular, constant work in his
editorial chair, indulging in flights of fancy only as a pastime.</p>

<p class='c030'>Mr. O’Connor was a master of the English language; indeed, it
is doubtful if any man on the American press ever wrote it better.
Some twenty years ago a correspondent of the <cite>New York Sun</cite> asked
Mr. Dana for information regarding literary style. In the course of
his reply he said:</p>

<p class='c030'>“Among the newspaper writers of our own country and of the
present day, perhaps the best style is that of Mr. Joseph O’Connor,
the editor of <cite>The Post Express</cite> of Rochester. It is terse, lucid,
calm, argumentative, and without a trace of effort or affectation.”</p>

<p class='c030'>After quoting this tribute, said Father Cronin of the <cite>Buffalo
Union and Times</cite>: “It is no small source of pride and gratification
to us to know that one of the great princes of American journalism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>is an Irish American. Mr. O’Connor’s pen is like the Damascene
blade, polished and beautiful, yet withal so smooth and keen that
the victim of its blow is severed in twain almost without realizing the
catastrophe. Long may Joseph O’Connor wield it, as he has always
wielded it, a menace to evil and a swift and sure protection to the
right.”</p>

<p class='c030'>All over the State of New York the daily and weekly papers, the
day after his death, contained most flattering and affectionate tributes
to his memory, and these were echoed and reinforced since by
the press of the whole country, for “The Rochesterian” gave the key
to the right solution of many a question to hundreds of editors who
sought in the exchanges for “J. O’C’s” latest.</p>

<p class='c030'>Said the <cite>Rochester Times</cite>: “For intelligence and insight he had
few peers among the great journalists of his time; but in addition
he had what some more renowned than he have lacked—absolute
bravery of conviction. His pen was unconditionally consecrated to
truth as he saw truth; and nothing could weaken his allegiance.
It is familiar history that he could have held some of the highest
posts in American journalism had he been willing to bend his honor
or relax his sincerity.”</p>

<p class='c030'>“Intellectually,” says the <cite>Syracuse Herald</cite>, “he was one of the
frankest and bravest of men, never hesitating to champion a cause
that appealed to his reason or humanity because it happened to be
temporarily unpopular.”</p>

<p class='c030'>“Journalism,” says the <cite>Troy Press</cite>, “loses a philosophical writer,
a brilliant scholar and a veritable ‘knowledge-box’ in the death of
Joseph O’Connor of <cite>The Post Express</cite>. He was one of the few
editors whose talent and resources were so abounding that adequately
to replace him is practically out of the question.”</p>

<p class='c030'>“He set before the men of his profession,” says the <cite>Rochester
Herald</cite>, “an example of frankness, courage, and independence which
is emulated wherever it is possible to follow it, and is admired and
envied where conditions do not permit of its acceptance. The utterances
of newspapers, elsewhere in the country as well as here, are
more sincere, more fearless, and freer from cant and sham because
of the ideals revered and upheld by Joseph O’Connor.”</p>

<p class='c030'>“Mr. O’Connor,” says the <cite>Rochester Times</cite>, “was a man of extensive
acquaintance, of legions of friends but with few ‘cronies.’
Among these favored few might be numbered Rev. Louis A. Lambert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>of Scottsville, editor-in-chief of the <cite>New York Freeman’s
Journal</cite>; Rev. John L. Codyre of Fairport, Judge John D. Lynn,
and a few others. His friendships were for literary characters
and their conversation was of the ultra intellectual thought. Abstruse
theological and philosophical problems were discussed with as
much freedom as ordinary persons talk of the weather. Yet Mr.
O’Connor in his kindly, lovable, winsome way could talk entertainingly
on the commonest topic with any acquaintance and his was
the tactful manner which never made one feel his smallness before
him.”</p>

<p class='c030'>Such is the tribute paid him by the <cite>Rochester, N. Y., Herald</cite> of
October 10th, 1908, in its editorial column.</p>

<p class='c030'>The Society, in response to its request for further information for
its archives, received the following communication from Mr. O’Connor’s
lifelong friend, Edmond Redmond, Esq., which we print in
full:</p>

      <div class='line in4'><em>Providence, R. I.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: I duly received your letter of the 5th instant requesting such
material as I may have in relation to a biographical sketch of the late Joseph
O’Connor.</p>

<p class='c037'>I assume that you have seen the notices printed in Rochester and other
newspapers immediately following his decease. I regret that I can add but
little to those eulogies, which were, I have reason to believe, written by intimate
associates and came from the heart.</p>

<p class='c037'>I thought that less was said by his recent friends about his interest in
Ireland and her cause than deserves to be known. And on that point I can
testify from acquaintance with him that few things were nearer or dearer to
him than the land of his ancestors. His pen and voice were ever ready to
work in the cause of Ireland, and I have no doubt that his personal fortunes, in
the ordinary commercial sense, suffered from the persistence with which, all
through life, he continued to bring to the attention of an indifferent public
the wrongs inflicted on the people of the island. It was, however, a labor of
love with him, and his zeal in the cause continued to the end. He had no
confidence in secret societies effecting any great good in Irish politics; but
he gave hearty support to the Land League in Parnell’s day. He was a delegate
to the famous Land League convention of 1886 in Chicago, and was
urged by friends to let them propose him for President of the American branch
of the Society. He has been heard to say that he was indebted to the Land
League for the experience which enabled him in later years to feel at home
on his feet while engaged in public speaking on other subjects.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>His regard for Ireland could not have been stronger had he been a native
of the land, and it was evidently inherited. Years ago he heard a friend
humming “As Slow Our Ship Her Foamy Track,” and said that when his
father was leaving Ireland a group gathered about him on the deck of the ship
as he sung that song, and before it was finished they were all in tears.</p>

<p class='c037'>Although usually slow to anger, he was liable to be moved on hearing the
creditable deeds of plain Irishmen ascribed, as they are so often, to the “Scotch-Irish,”—a
designation which he detested, employed as it usually is to detract
from Ireland the reflected honor to which she is entitled from the worthy
fame of her children.</p>

<p class='c037'>If the nature and scope of the work which you have in hand permits of
eulogy, it would be impossible to speak too highly of O’Connor’s character.
In both public and private life he was the soul of honor. His talents were
of the first order and always exerted toward good ends. His integrity was unbounding.
Like Gay his “manners were gentle, his affections mild.” In a
word he was a really great and uncommonly good citizen, a true and noble
man. One of his favorite poets was Goldsmith and I cannot better end this
too brief sketch than with what the author of “The Deserted Village” said of
Reynolds:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c038'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>To tell you my mind.</div>
      <div class='line'>He has not left a greater or better behind.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-r c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Very truly yours,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>EDMOND REDMOND.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>Mr. O’Connor was the author of many poems, and in 1895 the
Putnams brought out a little volume of his modestly entitled
“Poems.” Many of the shorter poems in the book are characterized
by delicate fancy and graceful rhyming; such poems as “Her
Hands,” “Water Lilies,” and the “Wine Song.” He favored these
smaller, slighter children of his fancy. He thought the best poem
he ever wrote was “The Cavalier Sword,” and next in order he
placed “The Fount of Castaly.” In our opinion “Her Hands” is
the sweetest and most graceful of them all, and we print it herewith:</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHIEF EGAN’S WAR RECORD WRITTEN FOR STATE ARCHIVES</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c033'>
    <div>FROM PROVIDENCE JOURNAL.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>David Irwin of San Francisco, an Irishman, formerly First Lieutenant of Company F, Third Rhode Island Heavy Artillery, who served under Gen. Charles R. Brayton, a guest and speaker at the dedication of the Society of the Sullivan Memorial December 16, 1908, has recently written a sketch of his service in the Army, and while compiling the story ran across several notes of incidents in
Army life which directly concern Chief of Police Patrick Egan, of
Providence, R. I.</p>

<p class='c030'>Mr. Irwin has forwarded the information to General Brayton,
in order that it may be preserved in the archives of the State. In
his letter Mr. Irwin says: “Being a native of the Emerald Isle,
I claim the right to make a little Irish bull by saying that when I
enlisted at Providence the only man I knew in my regiment was a boy
fifteen years old. The day that I made up my mind to be one of the
’200,000 more’ called for by President Lincoln, I went into the
workshop where this boy was learning the shoe trade and said to him,
‘Patsy, I am going to enlist. Don’t you want to go?’</p>

<p class='c030'>“He looked up with a smile on his face and replied: ‘Yes, if
you will.’</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘All right,’ I said, ‘come along. I’m going.’</p>

<p class='c030'>“I can imagine I see him now getting up from his bench, taking
off his apron, throwing it down and putting on his coat.</p>

<p class='c030'>“Away we went to the recruiting office and signed the roll, he
giving his age as seventeen, which no one doubted. He was tall for
his years.</p>

<p class='c030'>“I had hoped we would be placed in the same company, that I
might be near him and keep an eye on him, for I felt somewhat responsible
for taking him away from his widowed mother, but fate
or fortunes of war willed it otherwise. I was assigned to Company
G and he to Company C, which was afterward mounted as a light
battery. However, he soon proved to be well able to take care of
himself, except, perhaps, on one occasion.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“That was soon after the Port Royal, S. C., expedition,” Mr. Irwin
explains, “of which our regiment was a part, sailed from Hampton
Roads late in October, 1861, the land forces, consisting of about
12,500 men, being under Gen. Thomas W. Sherman, and a fleet of
seventeen warships and thirty transports and supply vessels, commanded
by Commodore Samuel F. DuPont.</p>

<p class='c030'>“About a week before sailing our regiment embarked on an old
steamship, which had been used for carrying cotton from New
Orleans to New York. Patsy’s company happened to be assigned
to the poorest quarters on the ship—the lower hold. The accommodations
for 1,000 men were none too good, consequently, we had
more or less sickness on board.</p>

<p class='c030'>“Hearing one day that Patsy was ill, I went in search of him, and
found him in a dark, poorly ventilated hole. He was a very sick
boy. I took him up to my company’s quarters and put him into
a berth near the hatchway, where he got better air, and, with a little
care—the best we could give him under the circumstances, as
we were then off Cape Hatteras and having very stormy weather—he
soon recovered and in a few days he was himself again.</p>

<p class='c030'>“It may not be out of place to relate here a little incident which
took place one night during the height of the storm. About midnight
the rain was coming down in sheets, the sea running high and
the wind blowing a gale, when, in an instant, over went the old ship
on her beam’s end. This caused quite a commotion among the boys—we
were all called ‘boys’ then—some of whom rushed to the hatchway
to get on deck, but were prevailed upon to remain below. One
of the foremost of them, ‘Jim’ Burns, a countryman of mine, dropped
on his knees on the stairs and commenced praying like a good fellow.
The others quieted down and paid all due respect to Jim
and his prayers. In a few minutes the ship righted again, and in
a short time the worst of the storm was over.</p>

<p class='c030'>“Next day things looked a little brighter and some of the boys
thought they might have a little fun at Jim’s expense. Being First
Sergeant of the company, they suggested that I appoint Jim Chaplain
of the company, seeing he had made such a good prayer the night before.
When I told him of their wishes, he looked at me with a
twinkle in his eye and replied:</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘No you don’t appoint me Chaplain. Let them go to the ‘divil,’
and do their own prayin’.’</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“After losing four of our supply vessels during the storm, we
arrived at our destination on the morning of November 7, 1861, and
witnessed the same day the bombardment and capture by the Navy
of Fort Walker on Hilton Head, and Fort Beauregard on Bay Point,
S. C. We landed on the ‘sacred soil’ late in the afternoon, our
regiment taking possession of the abandoned rebel fortifications.</p>

<p class='c030'>“I saw but little of Patsy after this. Active operations were soon
commenced, our regiment was broken up and the companies scattered
over the islands and swamps about Charleston and Savannah,
where they took a prominent part in the following: Siege and surrender
of Fort Pulaski, Ga., from January 1 to April 15, 1862;
battle of Secessionville, James Island, near Charleston, June 16,
1862; battle of Pocotaligo, S. C., on the Charleston and Savannah
Railroad, October 21, 1862; capture of Morris Island and Fort
Wagner, and in the bombardment and memorable siege of Fort Sumter,
1863, and many other smaller engagements.</p>

<p class='c030'>“In the spring of 1863 I met his captain (Brayton), who had
been a Lieutenant in my company and afterward Colonel of the regiment,
and asked him how ‘Patrick Egan’—that was the boy’s name—‘was
getting along.’</p>

<p class='c030'>“He answered, ‘Egan is getting along all right. He is one of my
best boys. I have just made him a corporal.’</p>

<p class='c030'>“The first time I met Patsy after this was on the disastrous battlefield
of Olustee, Florida, February 20, 1864. He was then a
Sergeant and had charge of a section of his battery, which was temporarily
attached to a four-gun Battery M of the First United States
Artillery. When I was ordered to retire from the field with the
remnant of the battery in which I was then serving, E, Third
United States Artillery, by the late Senator Hawley, who was then
Colonel of the Seventh Connecticut, and Acting Brigadier-General,
we passed near to where young Egan was, with his two guns in
position.</p>

<p class='c030'>“I rode up to him and exclaimed, ‘Patsy, what are you doing
here?’</p>

<p class='c030'>“His reply was, ‘We are doing the best we can.’</p>

<p class='c030'>“Not seeing any officers present, I then said to him, ‘You had better
get out of here as soon as possible, or you and your men and
guns will all be captured.’</p>

<p class='c030'>“He limbered up, withdrew a short distance and fired a few more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>shots of cannister which, I have no doubt, checked, at a critical
moment, the advance of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c030'>“It was now dark, and I believe these were the last guns fired at
the Battle of Olustee, where the Union troops under Gen. Truman
Seymour lost 1,900 men in killed, wounded and missing, and five
pieces of artillery, out of a force of about 4,500 men engaged.</p>

<p class='c030'>“The Confederates were supposed to have about 6,000 troops, commanded
by General Finnegan, and their loss was reported to be little
over 900.</p>

<p class='c030'>“This engagement seemed to be more like an ambuscade than anything
else. It was so unexpected—like a thunderclap out of a clear
sky. We were marching leisurely through a swampy, thickly-wooded
country from early morning until 3 p. m., when we came to a clearing
and found the enemy, who had been retreating for several days,
posted in a very strong, well-chosen position, partly intrenched and
sheltered by thick woods, while we were exposed to their deadly fire
in the open field, which accounts for the great difference in the losses.</p>

<p class='c030'>“We retired in good order during the night and next day to
Jacksonville, forty miles distant, with but little trouble from the
‘Johnnies.’ Here young Egan joined his own battery, turned over
his section to the commanding officer and reported a loss of one
man killed, six wounded and twelve horses killed or disabled. He
was slightly wounded himself and had a horse shot under him. The
battery to which his section was attached lost about thirty-five men
in killed, wounded and missing and three out of their four guns.</p>

<p class='c030'>“I will now quote an incident of camp life taken from his narrative
of the Florida campaign:</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘A few days after our arrival in Jacksonville the battery, together
with Barton’s Brigade, was ordered to Palatka. Palatka is
a small town seventy miles from Jacksonville, on the St. John’s
River, and is, at the present time, a winter resort for invalids. It
was here that the famous ‘cow incident’ took place, and ‘Who killed
the cow?’ afterward became a by-word in the brigade, especially
when Colonel Barton was within hearing distance.</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘It came about in this way: When we occupied Palatka, the
only white person in the village was an old lady, who had a fine
residence, and Colonel Barton, the commander of the brigade, made
his headquarters there. This woman had a very nice cow, the only
one in the village, and Barton was dependent upon her for milk.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“‘During the day the cow would feed in the dooryards and on
the lawns, and sometimes she would come around to where Battery
C was camped. One day some of the boys thought what a nice steak
and liver they could get from the cow, and, at the same time, get
square with Barton, he not being a favorite with the boys. They
thought they might kill two birds with one stone by getting the
steak and liver, and, at the same time, cut off Barton’s milk supply.
So the next day, when the cow came along, one of the boys
drove her into a back-yard near the camp, and, in a short time, that
cow was a thing of the past.</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘Steaks and liver were cut out for those who had done the
work and for their friends, and the rest of the meat was sent to
the cook house, where all had nice beef stew. Everything was all
right until milking-time, when the cow failed to show up. Then
the fun began. Men were sent out from headquarters and also from
the Provost Marshal’s office to try to find the cow and to make inquiries.</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘Of course, the men of Battery C knew nothing about her. But
they were eventually suspected, for the next morning the Provost
Marshal came to our quarters asking all sorts of questions. Some of
the boys, including your humble servant, knew nothing about it and
were sorry for the Colonel. The following morning Colonel Barton
sent for the non-commissioned officers and told us that he was
satisfied that the last seen of the cow was near Battery C’s camp.
He also said that all he wanted was the name of the man who killed
the cow, and that some of the non-commissioned officers must know
something about it. He then asked each one the name of the man
who killed the cow, but each denied all knowledge of it.</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘Well, someone must have given the whole thing away, for the
next day Captain James had the “assembly” blown and the company
fell in. He then called the names of nine men, comprising one Sergeant,
one Corporal, and seven privates. The Sergeant and Corporal
were reduced to the ranks, and, with the other seven, were
confined in the guard house, put on a diet of bread and water, and
made a “spread eagle” of until someone should tell who killed the
cow.</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘Morning and evening they were asked who killed the cow, but
they denied they knew who did it. This was carried on for three
days, when someone put up a job with the pickets, and on the afternoon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>of the third day they began firing, the long roll was sounded
and the prisoners were released to man the guns. No Johnnies appeared,
it being a bluff to get the men released. They could not
be punished again for the same offence, so thus ended the cow incident,
but Colonel Barton never found out who killed the cow.</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘In justice to Colonel Barton, who has joined the “Grand Army
above,” I wish to say that I knew him very well and served under
him for nearly a year, and found him to be a nice gentleman, a
strict disciplinarian, a good and a brave officer. I will also state that
I have good reason for believing that Comrade Egan took no part
in “cutting off the Colonel’s milk supply” and that the old lady was
compensated for the loss of the cow.’</p>

<p class='c030'>“In April, 1864, his battery was ordered to Fort Monroe, Va.,
where it joined General Butler’s Army of the James and participated
in all the battles, sieges and operations around Petersburg
and Richmond from May 4 to the close of the war, having fought
for the Union in four of the seceding States—South Carolina,
Georgia, Florida and Virginia. He was honorably discharged when
in sight of the steeples of Richmond, October, 1864. At the close
of the war his old battery was the first volunteer battery to enter
that long-coveted and hard-fought-for city—Richmond. To Capt.
Martin S. James of this battery was assigned the honor of dismantling
the fortifications around this famous stronghold and capital
of the Confederacy.</p>

<p class='c030'>“When next we met, August, 1904, at the National Encampment,
G. A. R., in Boston, Mass., I could hardly believe he was the same
boy I last saw—more than forty years before—on the battlefield of
Olustee. He was then (1904) a fine specimen of manhood; stood
six feet, one and one half inches, and weighed 240 pounds.”</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>THE SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDLY SONS OF ST. PATRICK IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK.</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c033'>
    <div>BY JOHN J. LENEHAN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>The Society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in the City of New York was instituted on March 17, 1784. It had its origin among Irish officers connected with the armies of the American Revolution. On November 25, 1783, the last British soldier departed from the shores of Manhattan, the British flag which had been nailed to the flagpole of Fort George was hauled down, the American flag was run
up in its place, and the Continental Army entered the city. It was
led by George Washington, then an adopted member of the Friendly
Sons of St. Patrick of Philadelphia. At his side rode the Governor,
General George Clinton, the son of an Irishman; and the advance
battalion was commanded by General Henry Knox, also the son
of an Irishman, and a member of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick
of Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c030'>In the environment produced by these conditions, in the atmosphere
of liberty and Constitutional government that followed the
advent of the American army into its final possession of New York
City, was born the Society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick.
Daniel McCormick was its founder and its president for many years.
The objects of the Society were to assist poor and distressed natives,
and descendants of natives, of Ireland, and promote friendly, social
feelings among its members.</p>

<p class='c030'>With these laudable purposes, on March 17, 1784, the first St.
Patrick’s Day following the evacuation of New York by the British,
the Society inaugurated its festive functions at “Cape’s Tavern.”
In the <cite>New York Packet and Advertiser</cite> of Thursday, March 18,
1784, the following appears:</p>

<p class='c039'>Yesterday, being the anniversary of St. Patrick, his patriotic sons met at
Cape’s Tavern, where they gave an elegant entertainment to his Excellency
the Governor, Lieut.-Governor, Chancellor and a number of other respectable
gentlemen of this State. The day and evening were spent in festivity and
mirth, and a number of suitable toasts were drunk upon this joyful occasion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>The greatest unanimity and conviviality pervaded this numerous and jovial
company, and perhaps this great Saint was never honoured with a concourse
of more generous and truly patriotic sons than this assembly afforded.</p>

<p class='c034'>Thus commenced (in the words of Curran), “those happy meetings
when the swelling heart conceived and communicated the pure and
generous purpose, the innocent enjoyment of social mirth expanded
into the nobler warmth of social virtue, and the horizon of the board
became enlarged into the horizon of man.” Almost uninterruptedly
since quarterly and anniversary meetings of the Society have been
held. Many of the leading men of the City and State are enrolled
among its members, and the records of the Society from the beginning
contain names prominent in the early history of the Republic.
Social and friendly intercourse was promoted and maintained among
the natives of Ireland and their kinsmen and descendants. Numbers
of deserving, but less fortunate fellow-countrymen, were relieved
by the bounty of the Society, implements and materials for
domestic manufacture were furnished to the industrious poor. The
needy were assisted with money, medicine, clothing and fuel, the
destitute were provided with homes and, when necessary, were furnished
with sufficient funds to enable them to return to their native
land.</p>

<p class='c030'>The design of the badge worn by members of the Society, and
which appears on the cover of this book, is a <cite>facsimile</cite> of the “reverse”
of the medal worn by the members of the Friendly Sons of St.
Patrick in Philadelphia in 1771. The following in reference to that
medal is from <cite>Haverty’s American Almanac</cite>:</p>

<p class='c039'>Each member was required to furnish himself with a gold medal of the
value of three guineas, agreeably to the following description: On the right,
HIBERNIA; on the left, AMERICA; in the center, LIBERTY joining the
hands of HIBERNIA and AMERICA, represented by the usual figures of
a female supported by a harp, for HIBERNIA; an Indian with his quiver
on his back and his bow slung, for AMERICA; underneath, UNITE. On the
reverse, ST. PATRICK tramping on a snake, a cross in his hand, dressed in
pontificalibus, the motto, “HIER.”</p>

<p class='c037'>These devices, designed some years before the Revolution, were certainly
ominous, if not prophetic. The Goddess of LIBERTY joining the hands of
HIBERNIA and AMERICA, with the superscription “UNITE,” was sufficiently
significant, considering that the effect of that union powerfully promoted
the subsequent dismemberment of the British Empire and the liberty
and independence of America. The motto, HIER, or, without the aspirate,
IER, in the Celtic language signifies “West,” and from it came the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>the country, Ere, Erin, or Ireland, and Ierna, aspirated Hibernia. But the
word HIER had in it a duplicate and equivocal signification, peculiarly appropriate
as the motto of a society whose object was to “<em>Unite</em>” in fellowship
the sons of the <em>little</em> isle of the “<em>West</em>” with those of the <em>great</em> continent of the
“West.” This medal the members were obliged to wear at the meeting of the
Society under the penalty of 7s. 6d. for neglect to do so on St. Patrick’s day,
and 5s. on the days of the quarterly meetings.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c034'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. The Friendly Sons of St. Patrick of Philadelphia was founded in 1771. George Washington,
adopted a member December 17, 1781, dined with the Society on St. Patrick’s Day, 1782, and characterized
it as “<em>a society distinguished for the firm adherence of its members to the glorious cause in which we
are embarked</em>.” Other members were Generals Moylan, Shee, Wayne, Knox, Butler, Irvine, Hand;
Commodore Barry, John Mease, who crossed the Delaware with General Washington on the memorable
night of December 25, 1776, and surprised the Hessians; and his brother, Matthew, who commanded the
quarter deck guns under Paul Jones in the <em>Bonhomme Richard’s</em> fight with the <em>Serapis</em>.</p>

<p class='c030'>On June 17, 1780, twenty-seven of its members subscribed 103,500 pounds sterling to furnish provisions
for the army, Robert Morris and Blair McClenachan each subscribing 10,000 pounds. William
Constable, another member, an aid of Lafayette and partner of Robert Morris, was one of the founders
of the New York Society.—<cite>Hood’s Friendly Sons of St. Patrick</cite>, 43–49 (Phila., 1844); <cite>Crimmins’ Early
Celebrations of St. Patrick’s Day</cite>, 215 (N. Y., 1902).</p>
</div>

<p class='c030'>The original records of the Society from 1784 to 1835, except the
Treasurer’s Book from 1804, were lost by fire in August, 1835, being
at that time in possession of the Secretary, whose place of business
was destroyed.</p>

<p class='c030'>The Society has been true to the principles on which it was
founded. It has helped the needy and distressed, and has been the
means of cementing lifelong friendships among its members and
among those who participated in its festivities. From the Society
grew the Irish Emigrant Society and the Emigrant Industrial Savings
Bank. Uniting to the charitable and humane the friendly and
social feelings, it seeks to keep ever vigorous the love of Ireland and
of the Irish character. It celebrates the festival of St. Patrick as
a national and immemorial custom, to commemorate the glory of Ireland,
to drop a tear upon her sorrows and to express a hope for her
regeneration. It has entertained illustrious and distinguished guests
at its banquets. Among those of recent years may be mentioned
President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905, and president-elect William
H. Taft in 1908. A notable dinner was given on May 29, 1902, to
the French Governmental Mission attending the Rochambeau Monument
ceremonies, in acknowledgement of which the Republic of
France presented to the Society a magnificent Sèvres vase, now in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>

<p class='c030'>Among the Society’s members have been many of the great merchants,
business and professional men of the city. To pass over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>living, on its rolls appear the names of Alexander Macomb, Hugh
Gaine, William Constable, Dominick Lynch, DeWitt Clinton, John
Caldwell, Thomas Addis Emmet, Robert J. Dillon, Joseph Stuart,
Richard Bell, William Kelly, Joseph P. Kernochan, John Haggerty,
Ogden Haggerty, William Sampson, David J. Graham,
Charles O’Conor, James T. Brady, John R. Brady, Dr. Robert
Hogan, Dr. William James MacNeven, Very Rev. Dr. John Power,
Thomas W. Clerke, Daniel Devlin, Henry L. Hoguet, Eugene Kelly,
Joseph J. O’Donohue, Richard O’Gorman, John Savage, Jeremiah
Devlin, William Whiteside, Thomas Barbour, Hugh J. Hastings,
Thomas Francis Meagher, James R. Cuming, Charles P. Daly,
Frederick Smyth, William R. Grace, William L. Brown, Peter
McDonnell, C. C. Shayne, Frank T. Fitzgerald, George C. Barrett,
Samuel Sloan, James S. Coleman, John Crane, Vincent P. Travers,
John Stewart, Daniel O’Day and Hugh Kelly. Grover Cleveland
was an honorary member.</p>

<p class='c030'>Of these, Dr. William James MacNeven and Thomas Addis Emmet,
whose names are indelibly written on the pages not only of
Irish history, but on the history of New York city and State, became
members of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in 1815. Facing
Broadway, in the graveyard of historic St. Paul’s, are reared the
columns upon which are noted their services to their native country
and to their adopted land, flanking on either side the tablet which
perpetuates the memory of that other great Irishman, who fell at
the siege of Quebec, General Richard Montgomery.</p>

<p class='c030'>Free from all religious and political characteristics, it is the representative
Irish society in the city of New York.</p>

<p class='c030'>In 1827 it was incorporated by the following act of the Legislature
of the State of New York:</p>

<p class='c032'>Mr. Lenehan is the Chairman of the Membership Committee of
the American Irish Historical Society, through whose efforts and
ability 250 members have been added to the Society’s rolls between
the time of his appointment in June, 1908, and January
16th, 1909, the date of the eleventh annual meeting in Washington,
D. C. New applications from him have been coming in almost
daily since the latter date. We look forward to at least an equal
number of new members being admitted during 1909, and the Society
hereby expresses the highest praise of Mr. Lenehan for his
faithful and fruitful efforts in its behalf. Under his guidance, the
printed matter which has gone forth during 1908 throughout the
country has been prepared and circulated, and in his work he is receiving
the cordial support of all the members.</p>

<p class='c030'>Although in the midst of a busy life as a successful practising
lawyer, Mr. Lenehan finds time to give valuable assistance by word

<h3 class='c001'>EARLY MARINE “WIRELESS.”</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c033'>
    <div>BY EDGAR STANTON MACLAY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>Not the least valuable of the many practical lessons taught by the cruise of the Atlantic battleship fleet around the world was the demonstration of the possibility of following from Washington almost every day’s move of the great white ships from their departure from Hampton Roads to their return, by means of wireless telegraphy and other methods of transmitting information. It is a
cardinal point in the strategy of naval warfare to be thoroughly advised,
first, of the location, disposition and conditions of your own
ships and, second, the same of your adversary’s.</p>

<p class='c030'>Some idea of the stupendous advances made in this most important
detail may be gained by a comparison with the “wireless” marine
telegraphy of a century ago when, although electricity had not been
harnessed to the news bureau, ingenious methods of maintaining a
“marine telegraph” were operative which, in some instances, were
most surprising in their results.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>At the outbreak of the War of 1812 our government planned a
crushing blow at British commerce. A fleet of 100 English merchantmen
from Jamaica was expected to pass close to the North
American coast and the most formidable squadron we could then
assemble, consisting of the frigates <em>President</em>, <em>United States</em> and <em>Congress</em>,
with the sloop and brig <em>Hornet</em> and <em>Argus</em>, under the command
of Captain John Rodgers, was held in New York ready to
sail. As soon as war was declared, June 18, 1812, a courier set out
from Washington and in three days arrived in New York—quick
work for those days, but the information now could be flashed in a
few seconds.</p>

<p class='c030'>One hour after receiving the news Rodgers got under way and
on the morning of the second day out spoke an American vessel and
learned from her master that he had seen the Jamaica fleet only two
days before. Rodgers made sail in the direction indicated, but he
was drawn away in a futile chase after the British frigate <em>Belvidera</em>.
Afterward, however, he resumed his pursuit of the merchant
fleet and on July 1 he detected “quantities of cocoanut shells and
orange peels” in the water, which showed that he was in the wake
of the fleet. He followed this sea-trail several days and was rapidly
overtaking the chase, when he lost it in the fogs on the Newfoundland
Banks.</p>

<p class='c030'>Floating bottles, pieces of wreckage, cask-heads and other ship
debris were the “clicks” of the first “marine wireless” that assisted
our early mariners in discovering the whereabouts of friend or foe
on the high seas. And even a marine “postoffice” was a service
recognized early in the 19th century—many years before it came into
general use on land. When our 32-gun frigate <em>Essex</em> was making
her memorable cruise in the Pacific Ocean, 1813–1814, Captain
David Porter records that he stopped at Charles Island of the
Galapagos in the southern Pacific Ocean to examine the “postoffice”—a
box nailed to a tree in which whalers and other craft deposited
records of their cruises and intended movements.</p>

<p class='c030'>That these ocean “postoffices” were sometimes used for “misinformation”
is shown in the case of this same Captain Porter.
One of these “postal stations” in the Atlantic was the penal island
of Fernando de Noronha, off the extreme eastern limit of Brazil.
This was a point usually touched by vessels bound for the Cape of
Good Hope or Cape Horn. While Porter was cruising in the south
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Atlantic under orders to join the <em>Constitution</em> and <em>Hornet</em>, he hove-to
off this port on December 14, 1812, and sending a boat ashore
learned that there was a letter there addressed to “Sir James Yeo,
of the British 32-gun frigate <em>Southampton</em>.” He also learned that
only the week before the English 44-gun frigate “<em>Acasta</em> and the 20-gun
sloop of war <em>Morgiana</em>” had stopped at that port and had
sailed for Rio de Janeiro, leaving a letter addressed to “Sir James
Yeo.”</p>

<p class='c030'>Before sailing from the United States Porter had been instructed
to pose as Sir James Yeo and was to join the <em>Constitution</em> and
<em>Hornet</em>, which two vessels were to pass as the <em>Acasta</em> and <em>Morgiana</em>,
off Cape Frio, Brazil. This was done to deceive the enemy.
When Porter learned that there was a letter at Fernando de Noronha
addressed to “Sir James Yeo,” he at once sent a present of porter
and cheese to the governor of the island and received the coveted
letter. It was found to contain the usual references of a voyage by
a British commander, but some “key words” induced Porter to hold
the letter to the flame of a candle, when the following instructions,
written in sympathetic ink, became legible: “I am bound off
Bahia, thence off Cape Frio, where I intend to cruise until the
1st of January. Go off Cape Frio, to the northward of Rio de
Janeiro, and keep a lookout for me. Your friend.”</p>

<p class='c030'>Captain Porter did as ordered, but on December 29 the <em>Constitution</em>
captured, after a hard fight, the British frigate <em>Java</em>, and soon
afterward the <em>Hornet</em> sank the English sloop of war <em>Peacock</em>.
This left the <em>Essex</em> free to choose her own course and the result was
her memorable cruise of two years in the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c030'>But the most remarkable instance of early marine wireless was
that of the chase after the <em>Constitution</em> from Boston, across the Atlantic,
by a powerful British squadron, which, on March 10, 1815,
cornered <em>Old Ironsides</em> in Port Praya, near the extreme western coast
of Africa, on the very day she entered that harbor and just seventy-six
days after the hostile vessels had sailed from the blockade of the
New England port.</p>

<p class='c030'>For more than eight months British cruisers had been holding the
dreaded <em>Constitution</em>—then commanded by Captain Charles Stewart—in
the Hub, but, late in December, 1814, she gave them the
slip and once again was in blue water. Running down to Bermuda,
where he captured the merchant ship <em>Lord Nelson</em>, Stewart stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>across the Atlantic to the Madeiras and then cruised for several
days within sight of the Rock of Lisbon. Shaping her course southward
again the <em>Constitution</em>, on February 20, 1815, after a brilliant
fight, captured the British cruisers <em>Cyane</em> and <em>Levant</em> and with his
two prizes entered Port Praya on the morning of March 10.</p>

<p class='c030'>Soon after the <em>Constitution</em> made her escape from Boston, a terrific
snow storm, lasting several days, compelled the English blockading
squadron to take refuge in Cape Cod Bay. On December 22,
while the British officers were making themselves as comfortable as
they could in the bitter cold, the English 18-gun brig sloop <em>Arab</em>,
Captain Henry Jane, arrived with the startling information that the
<em>Constitution</em> had escaped. At once there was a hurrying and scurrying
for immediate pursuit. Provisions, bought at an exorbitant
price from the canny landfolk, were hurried aboard and every preparation
was made for a chase of indefinite length.</p>

<p class='c030'>But in what direction were they to pursue? Absolutely nothing
is recorded in the log of the British flagship as to what course the
<em>Constitution</em> had taken. Here nautical sagacity, aided by the “wireless
telegraphy” then so remarkably in use on the high seas, came to
the aid of the British senior officer of the blockading force—Sir
George Collier, of the 50-gun frigate <em>Leander</em>. Sir George sagely
conjectured that the <em>Flying Yankee</em> would most likely take a southern
course so as to escape the bitterly cold winter of New England.
In those days there were no means for heating the cabins, wardroom,
steerage or berth decks of ships, so a prolonged stay in the higher
latitudes was a problem to be seriously considered. Selecting the
50-gun frigate <em>Newcastle</em>, Captain Lord George Stuart, and the
40-gun frigate <em>Acasta</em>, Captain Kerr, to accompany him, Sir George,
on December 24th, made sail in a blind chase southward.</p>

<p class='c030'>It seems that on the night of December 21st the famous American
privateer, <em>Prince de Neuchâtel</em>, also escaped from Boston and made
the same course the <em>Constitution</em> had taken. When only a day or so
out she ran into the same storm that drove the English blockading
ships into Cape Cod Bay.</p>

<p class='c030'>On the morning of December 28, just as the gale was abating and
only four days after the British squadron sailed, Sir George overtook
the <em>Prince de Neuchâtel</em> and captured her; and from some of
the Englishmen who were aboard the privateer learned somewhat of
the proposed itinerary of the <em>Constitution</em>. With this first direct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>trace of his game, the British commander shaped his course across
the Atlantic for the coast of Spain.</p>

<p class='c030'>How eager the English were to capture the <em>Constitution</em>, above
all other American frigates, may be seen in the record of a sailor
who was in the <em>Prince de Neuchâtel</em> at the time. He says that after
being taken aboard the <em>Leander</em> as a prisoner he noticed a large placard
nailed to her mainmast, which read as follows:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c035'>
    <div>REWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c037'>“A reward of One Hundred pounds sterling to the man who shall
first descry the American frigate <em>Constitution</em>, provided she can be
brought to, and a smaller reward should they not be enabled to come
up with her.”</p>

<p class='c034'>This same sailor writes: “Every one [in the <em>Leander</em>] was eager
in his inquiries about this far-famed frigate and most of the men
appeared anxious to fall in with her, she being a constant theme of
conversation, speculation and curiosity. There were, however, two
seamen and a marine—one of whom had had his shin sadly shattered
from one of her grape-shot—who were in the frigate <em>Java</em> when
she was captured. These I have often heard say, in return to their
shipmates’ boastings: ‘If you had seen as much of the <em>Constitution</em>
as we have, you would give her a wide berth, for she throws her
shot almighty careless, fires quick, aims low and is, altogether, an
ugly customer.’”</p>

<p class='c030'>Continuing on his trail of the much-coveted Yankee frigate, Sir
George, on January 4, 1815,—seven days after sailing—while off
the Western Isles, received another “wireless click” when he picked
up a prize brig belonging to the American privateer <em>Perry</em> and from
her master learned that the <em>Perry</em> had spoken the <em>Constitution</em> only
a few days before, on a course that would indicate that she was
making for the coast of Spain. As a matter of fact, this powerful
British squadron was at that moment only a few hours’ sail from the
<em>Constitution</em>.</p>

<p class='c030'>Touching at the port of Fayal, January 13th, 1815, Sir George’s
chase after <em>Old Ironsides</em> nearly terminated in disaster. A record
left by one of the American prisoners in the <em>Leander</em> says: “We
ran in with a southwest wind that had freshened to a stiff breeze
till coming under the lee of the Peak of Pico, opposite to Fayal.
This aided a little in breaking the wind and the heavy swell which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>came rolling in from the open sea beyond. Immediately to leeward
was a rocky, perpendicular bluff of three hundred feet in
height, which the sea was breaking against with the greatest fury.</p>

<p class='c030'>“I had taken my perch upon the booms so as to have a chance of
clearly seeing the working of the frigate, as well as the different objects
of curiosity within my range.... The anchor was let
go and the cable spun out to its entire length with the most fearful
swiftness. But when all was out the frigate still went, stern-on,
toward the bluff, as though the anchor was yet at the cathead.
When she had drifted so as to be without the shelter of the Peak
and exposed to the wind and heavy swell, both driving her on to
inevitable destruction, unless suddenly checked in her course, none
was so blind as not to see the peril, the almost instant annihilation
with which the frigate was threatened, and in a twinkling it was
known that the anchor had not taken hold, but was dragging.</p>

<p class='c030'>“What means were adopted for the safety of the ship I know not,
for my curiosity had full employment in following the old commodore
[Sir George Collier] about the deck in his mad ravings.
I have read and heard much of the coolness, intrepidity and readiness
of the English naval officers in all sudden cases of emergency
and danger; and this commodore was one of the oldest in commission
and a staunch veteran in the service. He had seen long service,
fought many a fight, been slashed and cut to disfiguration—as his
numerous scars plainly told—had had one of his legs broken at three
different places, at three separate periods between the hip and knee,
each setting worse than the last, making his leg crooked, more
crooked, most crooked.</p>

<p class='c030'>“When he saw that the frigate was gathering sternway toward the
bluff, he raved, stormed and swore at the ship, cable, anchor, officers,
men, boys, hell and the devil, clinching each oath separately
by a whack of his cane at and on everything within his reach. Now
he was running toward the wheel at the stern, then furiously driving
across the deck to the hawseholes at the bow, tacking first to larboard,
then to the starboard side of the ship; yelling at the first
lieutenant for not making the anchor hold on, swearing at the anchor
for not obeying the lieutenant, damning the cable for not being
longer, the water for being so deep, the bottom for lying so
low; and, at last, when he had nothing else to crisp with his red-hot
blessings, he blasted his own eyes, heart, liver and lights, winding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>up with a curse upon the prisoners, conveying their souls in a
trice to the lower regions without benefit of clergy, for being the
cause of all the disasters in store for him and his frigate—henceforth
and forever.</p>

<p class='c030'>“I was as fully sensible of the danger of our situation as any one,
but I could not suppress my laughter at the antics which this hero
of many wars was cutting about the decks. I have no simile nor
comparison for his movements, for, verily, there is none. It was not
a hitch-and-go-ahead, nor a half-hitch and side lurch; neither was
it a back-and-fill, balance-haul or a bob-and-hop, straddling slide.
No more like a cock-and-primed, tip-toe dance than a toe-and-heel,
fore-and-after is like a cut-and-thrust, forward-spring, a back-staggering
or blinker-wiper. It partook of the whole in about equal
parts. In fact, I could liken his run with his crooked leg to nothing
but the effort of the crab to walk upright upon a slippery surface,
doggedly intent to win the wager of the half-blown terrapin,
who, in the same attitude, is being balked in his first trial at the
double-shuffle by attempting it in a wig, gown and Wellingtons instead
of short-cuts and pumps and going at it with sleeves rolled up
as an honest one should.</p>

<p class='c030'>“At last the second anchor brought her up, and lucky it was that
it did, for she had drifted within a few minutes’ distance of the bluff,
where the frigate would not have held together five minutes. With
the freshened winds and lashing waves throwing the spray mast-high,
every soul on board must have been lost, for the water was deep and
the first thing the frigate would have struck was the perpendicular
cliff—three hundred feet high and of unknown depth below.”</p>

<p class='c030'>After this narrow escape Sir George transferred his prisoners to
the sloop of war <em>Pheasant</em> and, after replenishing his stores, resumed
his chase after the Yankee frigate. Just what course was pursued
by the commander from this point is not shown in American or
British records. It is a fact, however, that the presence of the
<em>Constitution</em> in European waters was known in many ocean ports and
that several British cruisers were sent out from Lisbon, Gibraltar
and other nearby ports to intercept her.</p>

<p class='c030'>It was, undoubtedly, by means of this “wireless marine telegraphy”
that Sir George so shaped his course, after leaving Fayal, that he
arrived off Port Praya, March 10, 1815, only a few hours after the
<em>Constitution</em> with her two prizes, the <em>Cyane</em> and <em>Levant</em>, had entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>that harbor. The miraculous escape of the American frigate
from Sir George’s overwhelming force in the offing of Port Praya is
a matter of history. It is recorded that he was so chagrined over
the extraordinary escape of the <em>Constitution</em>—after he had so successfully
followed her, by means of the first “marine wireless,”
across the Atlantic—that ten years afterward, on being reminded
of the incident, he committed suicide.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>SKETCHES OF WILLIAM DUNLAP, THOMAS P. JOHNSON AND THOMAS SHARP, DISTINGUISHED IRISH AMERICANS DURING REVOLUTIONARY TIMES.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c033'>
    <div>BY JAMES L. O’NEILL OF ELIZABETH, N. J., A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c030'>The following short series of articles relate to distinguished people of our race who played prominent parts in the stirring scenes during the Revolution, and whose memoirs are full of interesting anecdotes and descriptions of those times.</p>

<p class='c030'>William Dunlap, son of Samuel Dunlap, who was a native of Ireland,
Thomas P. Johnson, one of the prominent members of the
New Jersey Bar 100 years ago, and others are referred to. Mr.
Dunlap himself, in his memoirs, gives a graphic description of
Revolutionary scenes in New Jersey. Another of the articles is a
history by Thomas Sharp, a member of the Society of Friends, of
Newton, Gloucester County, N. J. The brief history is here quoted
exactly as compiled by the ancient author, and its quaint language,
with its disregard for spelling and construction, is interesting.
Thatcher, a military writer of that time, gives a characteristic anecdote
of Washington, which is here appended.</p>

<h4 class='c031'><span class='sc'>Revolutionary Times in Perth Amboy.</span></h4>

<p class='c032'>Perth Amboy, N. J., was the home of Governor Franklin, who
was made a prisoner by the Colonials in the Revolution, and sent
to Connecticut for safe-keeping.</p>

<p class='c030'>William Dunlap, painter and author, was also a native of Perth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Amboy, and a graphic description of “olden times” is contained in
his own memoirs in his “History of the Arts of Design.” He says:</p>

<p class='c030'>“I was born in the city of Perth Amboy and province of New Jersey.
My father, Samuel Dunlap, was a native of the north of Ireland
and son of a merchant of Londonderry. In youth he was devoted
to the army and bore the colors of the Forty-seventh Regiment,
‘Wolfe’s Own,’ on the Plains of Abraham. He was borne wounded
from the field on which his commander triumphed and died. After
the French war, Dunlap, then a lieutenant in the Forty-Seventh,
and stationed at Perth Amboy, married Margaret Sargent, of that
place, and retired from the army to the quiet of a country town
and country store. The 19th of February, 1766, is registered as
the date of my birth, and being an only child, the anniversary of the
important day was duly celebrated by my indulgent parents. Of
education I had none, in the usual sense of the word, owing to circumstances
I shall mention, and much of that which is to the child
most essential was bad.</p>

<p class='c030'>“Holding negroes in slavery was, in those days, the common practice,
and the voices of those who protested against the custom were
not heeded. Every house in my native place where any servants
were to be seen swarmed with black slaves. My father’s kitchen had
several families of them, of all ages and all born in the family except
one, who was called a new negro, and who had his face tattooed. His
language was scarcely intelligible, though he had been long in the
country, and was an old man. These blacks indulged me, of course,
and I sought the kitchen as the place to find playmates and
amusements suited to my taste. Thus in the mirth and games of
the negroes, and the variety of visitors of the black race who frequented
the place, my desires were shaped. This may be considered
my first school, and, indeed, such was the education of many a boy
in the states where the practice of slavery continued. The infant
was taught to tyrannize, the boy was taught to despise labor, the
mind of the child was contaminated by hearing and seeing that
which, perhaps, was not understood at the time but which remained
in the memory. These kitchen associations were increased during
a part of the Revolution by soldiers, who found their mess fare
improved by visiting the negroes, and by servants of officers billeted
in the house.</p>

<p class='c034'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>“Perth Amboy being now in the possession of the British, my
father returned with his family to his home, and I saw in my native
town, particularly after the battles of Princeton and Trenton, all
the discomforts of a crowded camp and garrison. An army which
had recently passed in triumph from the sea to the banks of the
Delaware, and chosen its winter quarters at pleasure, was now
driven in, crowded upon a shore washed by the Atlantic, and defended
by the guns of the ships which had borne it thence.</p>

<p class='c030'>“I have elsewhere compared the scenes I now witnessed to the
dramatic scenes of Wallenstein’s Lager. Here was centered in addition
to the soldiery cantoned at the place all those drawn in from
the Delaware, Princeton and Brunswick, together with the flower of
the army, English, Scotch, and German, which had been brought in
from Rhode Island. Here was to be seen a party of the Forty-Second
Highlanders in national costume, and there a regiment of Hessians,
their dress and arms a wide contrast to the first. The slaves
of Anspach and Waldeck were there, the first somber as night, the
second gaudy as noonday. Here dashed by a party of the Seventeenth
dragoons, and there scampered a party of Yagers. The
trim, neat and graceful English Grenadier, the careless and half-savage
Highlander, with his flowing robes and naked knees, and
the stiff German, could hardly be taken as members of one army.
Here might be seen soldiers driving in cattle, and others guarding
wagons loaded with household furniture instead of the hay and oats
they had been sent for.</p>

<p class='c030'>“The landing of the grenadiers and light infantry from the ships
which transported the troops from Rhode Island; their proud march
into the hostile neighborhood, to gather the produce of the farmer
for the garrison; the sound of the musketry, which soon rolled back
upon us; the return of the disabled veterans who could retrace their
steps; and the heavy march of the discomfited troops, with their
wagons of groaning wounded, in the evening, are all impressed on
my mind as pictures of the horrors and the soul-stirring events of
war.</p>

<p class='c030'>“These scenes and others more disgusting—the flogging of English
men and thumping and caning of German—which even my
tender years could not prevent me from seeing all around, and the
increased disorder among my fathers’ negroes, from mingling with
the servants of officers, these were my sources of instruction in the
winter of 1776–1777.”</p>

  <h4 class='c031'><span class='sc'>Thomas P. Johnson, Noted Lawyer One Hundred Years Ago.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c032'>Among the distinguished men who have adorned the New Jersey
bar few, in their day, were held in higher repute for eloquence and
extensive legal knowledge, and especially for intellectual vigor and
versatility of talent, than Thomas P. Johnson.</p>

<p class='c030'>He was born about the year 1761. His parents were Friends.
His father, William Johnson, a native of Ireland, emigrated to this
country about 1747. He married Ruth Potts, of Trenton. Thomas
was their second child. When he was quite small the family removed
to Charleston, S. C., where the father established a flourishing
boarding-school and gained much repute by his lectures on various
branches of Natural Philosophy. His fondness for such studies
seemed to have been inherited by the son, who even in his later years
continued to turn his attention to them. The father died in the
South, after a residence of some years there. The mother, with five
children, returned to her native state, and with the aid of her brother
opened a store in Trenton. There Thomas was placed an apprentice
to a carpenter<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and joiner. After following this business some
time he was compelled, by a rupture of a blood vessel in the lungs,
to abandon it. He then engaged in teaching in Hunterdom County
and afterwards in Bucks County, Pa.—later then in Philadelphia.
For this profession he had rare qualifications. Few men had such
powers of communication; few could so simplify truth, and throw
an interest around it to captivate the youthful mind.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c030'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. The annexed anecdote was communicated to the compiler by a resident of Trenton: At one of
the neighboring courts a dispute arose between Johnson and his opponent respecting a point of law, during
which the latter remarked in a taunting, derisive manner, “That he was not to be taught law by a
carpenter.” “May it please your honors,” replied Mr. Johnson, “the gentleman has been pleased to
allude to my having been a carpenter. True, I was a carpenter. I am proud of it. So was our Lord
and Saviour. And I could yet, given a block of wood, a mallet and a chisel, hew something that would
very much resemble that gentleman’s head. True, I could not put in brains, but it would have more
manners.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c030'>While in Philadelphia a mercantile house took him in partnership,
and sent him to Richmond, Va., where the firm opened a large
store. There he became well acquainted with Chief Justice Marshall,
and often had the privilege of listening to the first lawyers in
the Old Dominion. This probably led to his turning his thoughts
to the bar. After a few years the loss of his store and goods by fire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>caused him to return to the scenes of his youthful days. He took
up his residence at Princeton, there married a daughter of Robert
Stockton, and entered his name as a student of law in the office of
the Hon. Richard Stockton. In due time he was admitted to the
bar as an attorney and counselor. His career was brilliant.
Whether arguing points of law, or spreading a case before a jury,
he was always heard with fixed attention and lively interest. So
lucid was he in arranging and expressing his thoughts, so quick to
seize hold of strong points in a case, and, when he pleased, so well
able to touch the chords of feeling, that he rarely failed to produce
an impression.</p>

<p class='c030'>He was no indifferent student of the great political questions.
With the majority of the New Jersey bar, he belonged to the Washington
school, and exerted all his energies in what he honestly conceived
to be his country’s real interests. For his brethren of the
New Jersey bar he cherished a warm attachment, and they were forward
in evincing their high esteem of his worth. A few years before
his death a number of them obtained the services of an artist
and had a full-length portrait of him executed. This now
hangs over the judge’s chair in the court-room at Flemington. He
died March 12, 1838.</p>

<h4 class='c031'><span class='sc'>History of Newton, Gloucester County, N. J.</span></h4>

<p class='c032'>Newton, Gloucester County, N. J., was early settled by the society
of Friends. The following history was written by Thomas
Sharp, the first conveyancer and surveyor of the county:</p>

<p class='c039'>“Let it be remembered. It having wrought upon ye minds of
some, Friends that dwelt in Ireland, a pressure having laid upon
them for some years which they could not get from under the weight
of until they gave upp to leave their friends and relations there,
together with a comfortable subsistence to transport themselves and
familys into this wilderness part of America, and there by expose
themselves to difficulties, which, if they could have been easy where
they were, in all probability might never have been met with; and
in order thereunto, sent from Dublin in Ireland to one Thomas Lurtin
a friend in London commander of a Pink, who accordingly came,
and made an agreement with him to transport them and their familys
into New Jersey, viz.; Mark Newby and family. Thomas
Thackarg and family, William Bate and family, George Goldsmith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>an old man, and Thomas Sharp, a young man, but no familys;
and whilst the ship abode in Dublin harbor providing for the voyage,
said Thomas Lurtin was taken so ill that could not perform ye same,
so that his mate, John Dagger, undertook it. And upon the 19
day of September, in the year of our Lord, 1681, we sett sail, from
the place aforesaid, and <a id='t207'></a>through the good Providence of God towards
us we arrived at Elsinburg, in the country of Salem, upon the 19
day of November following, where we were well entertained at the
houses of the Thomsons, who came from Ireland about four years
before, who, by their industry, were arrived to a very good degree of
living, and from thence we went to Salem, where were several
houses yet were vacant of persons who had left the town to settle in
ye country, which serve to accommodate them for ye winter, proving
moderate, we at Wickacog, among us, purchased a boat of the
Swansons, and so went to Burlington to the commissioners, of whom
we obtained a warrant of ye surveyor general, which then was
Daniel Leeds; and after some considerable search to and fro in
that then was called the third or Irish tenth, we at last pitched upon
the place now called Newton, which was before the settlement of
Phila; Pa; and then applied to S,d Surveyor, who came and laid
it out for us; and the next Spring, being the beginning of the year
1682 we all removed from Salem together with Robert Lane, that
had been settled there, who came along from Ireland with the
Thomsons before hinted, and having expectation of our coming only
bought a lot in Salemtown, upon the which he seated himself until
our coming, whose proprietary right and ours being of the same nature,
could not then take it up in Fenwicks tenth, and so began our
settlement; and although we were at times pretty hard bestead,
having all our provisions as far as Salem to fetch by water, yet,
through the mercy and kindness of God, we were preserved in health
and from any extreme difficulties.</p>

<p class='c037'>“And immediately there was a meeting sett upp and kept at the
house of Mark Newby, and in a short time it grew and increased,
unto which William Cooper and family, that lived at the Poynte
resorted, and sometimes the meeting was kept at his house, who had
been settled sometime before. Zeal and fervency of spirit was what,
in some degree, at that time abounded among friends, in commemoration
of our prosperous success and eminent preservation, both in
our coming over the great deep as also that whereas we were but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>few at that time, and the Indians many, where by it put a dread
upon our spirits, considering they were a savage people; but ye
Lord, that hath the hearts of all in his hands, which cannot be
otherwise accounted but to be the Lord doings in our favor, which
we had cause to praise his name for.</p>

<p class='c037'>“And that the rising generation may consider that the Settlement
of the country was directed by an impulse upon tranquility, but
rather for the posterity yet should be after, and that the wilderness
being planted with a good seed, might grow and increase to the
satisfaction of the good husbandman. But instead thereof, if for
wheat it should bring forth tares, they themselves will suffer loss.</p>

<p class='c037'>“This narration I have thought good and requisite to leave behind,
as having had knowledge of things from the beginning.”</p>

<h4 class='c031'><span class='sc'>Anecdote of Washington.</span></h4>

<p class='c032'>Thatcher, in his Military Journal, gives a vivid description of the
sufferings of the troops during “the hard winter of 1779–1780,”
at Morristown, N. J. He says:</p>

<p class='c039'>“Morristown, January 1st, 1780. A new year commences, but
brings no relief to the sufferings and privations of our army. Our
canvass covering affords but a miserable security from storms of
rain and snow, and a great scarcity of provisions still prevails, its
effects being felt even at headquarters, as appears by the following
anecdote: ‘We have nothing but the rations to cook, Sir,’ said
<em>Mrs. Thomson</em>, a very worthy <em>Irish woman</em>, and <em>housekeeper</em> to <em>General
Washington</em>. ‘Well, Mrs. Thomson, you must then cook the
rations, for I have not a farthing to give you.’ ‘If you please, Sir,
let one of the gentlemen give me an order for six bushels of salt.’
‘Six bushels of salt for what?’ ‘To preserve the fresh beef, Sir.’
One of the aids gave the order and the next day his Excellency’s
table was amply provided. Mrs. Thomson was sent for, and told
that she had done very wrong to expend her own money, for it was
not known when she could be repaid. ‘I owe you,’ said his Excellency,
‘too much already to permit the debt being increased, and our
situation is not at this moment such as to induce sanguine hope.’
‘Dear Sir,’ said the good old lady, ‘it is always darkest just before
the daylight, and I hope your Excellency will forgive me for bartering
the salt for other necessaries which are now on the table.’ Salt
was eight dollars a bushel, and it might always be exchanged with
the country people for articles of provision.”</p>

<h3 class='c001'>THE FIRST CENSUS OF THE UNITED STATES. SOME POINTED COMMENTS ON THE MANNER OF TAKING SAME AND THE RESULTS THEREOF. AN INTERESTING PAPER ON A SUBJECT NOT HERETOFORE TOUCHED BY THE SOCIETY.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c033'>
    <div>BY MICHAEL J. O’BRIEN OF NEW YORK CITY, AUTHOR OF “A GLANCE AT SOME PIONEER IRISH IN THE SOUTH,” IN VOLUME VII OF THE JOURNAL, AND OF MANY OTHER WORKS OF HISTORICAL RESEARCH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>By an Act of Congress, entitled “An act providing for the enumeration of the inhabitants of the United States,” and which was signed by President Washington on March 1, 1790, the marshals of the judicial districts throughout the United States were “authorized and required to cause the number of the inhabitants within their respective districts to be taken, omitting in such enumeration
Indians not taxed, and distinguishing free persons, including those
bound to service for a term of years, from all others.” These returns
they were instructed to file with the clerks of their respective
District Courts, who were directed to carefully preserve them.</p>

<p class='c030'>This was the <span class='sc'>First Census</span> taken of the inhabitants of the United
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>States, but it was far from complete, for the reason that “heads
of families” only were recorded.</p>

<p class='c030'>Eighteen months were allowed in which to complete the enumeration.
The census-taking was supervised by the marshals of the
several judicial districts, who employed assistant marshals to act
as enumerators.</p>

<p class='c030'>When the schedules were all gathered in, they were turned over
to the President, who, on October 27, 1791, transmitted to Congress
a summary of the result, which was published in what is
now a very rare little volume that has not been reprinted for public
use. The original schedules are contained in 26 bound volumes
and are still preserved in the Census Office. They form a curious
and most interesting collection, written as they were by the assistant
marshals, “on such paper as they happened to have, and binding
the sheets together. In some cases printed blanks furnished by the
States were used, in others merchants’ account paper, and now and
then the schedules were bound in wall paper.”</p>

<p class='c030'>A complete set of schedules for each State, with a summary for
the Counties, and in many cases for towns, was filed in the State
Department, but, unfortunately, they are not now complete, “the
returns for the States of Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey,
Tennessee and Virginia having been destroyed when the British
burned the Capitol at Washington during the War of 1812.”</p>

<p class='c030'>In 1907, Congress authorized the Director of the Census to publish,
in a permanent form, the First Census of the United States.
“These schedules,” says the Director of the Census, “form a unique
inheritance for the nation, since they represent for each of the
States a complete list of the heads of families in the United States
at the time of the adoption of the Constitution. The framers were
the statesmen and leaders of thought, but those whose names appear
upon the schedules of the First Census were in general the plain
citizens, who, by their conduct in war and peace, made the Constitution
possible, and by their intelligence and self-restraint put it
into successful operation.”</p>

<p class='c030'>The First Census has a peculiar interest for Americans of Irish
blood or descent, for here we find irrefutable evidence of the racial
origin of a large part of the people of the United States a few years
after the close of the Revolutionary war. There is, of course, no
standard, or fixed rule or principle, by which an absolutely correct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>judgment on the question of the racial composition of the early
inhabitants of the United States can now be formed. The available
statistics on the subject are incomplete and confusing.</p>

<p class='c030'>But, if names are to be accepted as a criterion, those who examine
the Census Returns, in conjunction with the records of land grants,
the parochial registers, the Colonial Records that have been collected
and edited by the secretaries of state, the court and church
records, the Revolutionary rosters, the old newspapers, the Registers
of Historical Associations, and other similarly reliable records,
must at once conclude that a goodly percentage of the people were
of old Irish stock.</p>

<p class='c030'>It must be borne in mind also that the Census enumerators made
no returns of unmarried persons. This fact is important, when we
place beside it the statements of reliable historians that the Irish
exodus of the 18th century largely comprised the youth of the country.
From the records which we have already quoted, we know
that thousands of the Irish youth became indentured servants after
their arrival in the Colonies, and it is not likely that these people,
even though married while still in servitude, were considered of
sufficient importance by the census enumerators to be included in
the lists of the “heads of families.”</p>

<p class='c030'>One who examines these records for traces of the Irish settlers
will be surprised to find a most inviting field of retrospect and research
ever widening before him. We do not need to wander into
the field of romance, as some writers occasionally do, in search of
proof that at the beginnings of the Nation the Celtic element figured
to a larger extent than it has been credited with at the hands
of our historians.</p>

<p class='c030'>There is so much of dry fact concerning them in these hitherto
obscure records as to make it a perplexing thought for the investigator
where to begin upon an exposition of the part played by
the Irish Colonists and their descendants in shaping the destinies
of the future Republic. Theirs is generally a prosaic story
of trials bravely borne, of victories snatched from rude nature in
the face of many difficulties. The pioneer settlers lived a simple
but rude life on the frontiers of civilization, free from the artificialities
of our latter-day mode of living, but they made the wilderness
which they found to blossom as the rose and to become a fair
habitation for the generations that have succeeded them.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Their story would hardly be worth relating were it not for the
fact that it affords the proof that men and women of our race and
blood were of the “warp and woof” from which has been evolved
the new and composite race, miscalled “Anglo-Saxon,” which has
made this Western Hemisphere the leader among the nations of
the civilized world.</p>

<p class='c030'>It is in the Census of the Southern States that Irish names appear
in the greatest numbers. During the first half of the 18th century
there were large immigrations of Irish people to the Carolinas,
who spread themselves over an immense area, reaching from the
Santee river to the eastern boundary line of Georgia, and as far
north as the dividing line of North Carolina. Doubtless, the majority
of those on the Census Returns bearing Irish names were
descendants of those early settlers, rather than natives of Ireland.</p>

<p class='c030'>The historian Lossing says: “Between the years 1730 and 1740
an Irish settlement was planted near the Santee river in South Carolina,
to which was given the name of Williamsburg Township.
Up the Pedee, Santee, Edisto, Savannah and Black rivers settlements
spread rapidly, and soon the axe and the plough were plying
with mighty energy, and from the North of Ireland such numbers
departed for Carolina that the depopulation of whole districts was
threatened.”</p>

<p class='c030'>Williamsburg he calls a “hotbed of rebellion” during the Revolutionary
war. As soon as General Francis Marion received his commission
from Governor Rutledge, we are told, “he sped to the district
of Williamsburg between the Santee and Pedee to lead its rising
patriots to the field of active military duties.” (The rosters of General
Marion’s brigade contain a large number of Irish names.)</p>

<p class='c030'>Ramsay also refers to these Irish settlements and deals with them
at length in his History of South Carolina. He says that the district
was named Williamsburg by an Irishman named James, who
came to the Colony with his father in 1733. It is now called
Kingstree, and the county in which it is situated is still named
Williamsburg.</p>

<p class='c030'>Sims’ <cite>Life of General Marion</cite> says: “the people of Williamsburg
were sprung generally from Irish parentage. They inherited in
common with all the descendants of the Irish in America a hearty
detestation of the English name and authority. This feeling rendered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>them excellent patriots and daring soldiers wherever the British
lion was the object of hostility.”</p>

<p class='c030'>Other local historians of the South also refer to the Irish settlements
in this territory, which continued with but intermittent
intervals down to the closing years of the 18th century. When
we turn to the Census schedules we find that the statements of the
historians are amply corroborated.</p>

<p class='c030'>In the Williamsburg district, that “hotbed of rebellion,” we find
mention of such Irish families as Burke, Barrett, Biggen, Butler,
Barron, Bryan, Broaderick, Boland, Brady, Bradley, Cain, Cummins,
Connor, Cunningham, Collins, Conway, Callihan, Cronan, Cantey,
Corbett, Connell, Castlelaw, Creed, Conally, Cochran, Dunn,
Dempsey, Dawson, Dollard, Downing, Donoho, Donnally, Delaney,
Dillin, Dailey, Dulon, Dogharty, Earley, Flin, Foley, Fitzpatrick,
Faning, Gorman, Galaspy, Gibbons, Gallivant, Ganey, Gowen,
Gavin, Gallaher, Gill, Garven, Hagan, Hart, Harrington, Hayes,
Hainey, Joice, Jordan, Kennedy, Keenan, Kelly, Kelty, Keen, Keefe,
Kerns, Kailey, Lynch, Leysath, Murphy, McCalvey, McCartney,
McGill, McFarlin, Manning, McCormic, McKenny, McDowell,
McKee, McGinney, McCauley, McBride, McMullan, Mulhollen,
Mitchel, McConnell, McClare, McIlveen, McGee, McFadden,
Moore, McCottery, McElroy, McMelly, McCleary, McDaniel, McDonald,
McCarthy, McCall, McSwain, McWilliams, Morrison, McGraw,
McCausland, McCune, McElhaney, McFail, McClendon,
McGrath, McElduff, McAdams, McCoy, McCary, McCain, Mahon,
O’Brian, O’Neil, O’Cain, O’Bannon, Phelon, Powers, Quinn, Rogers,
Roach, Riley, Reidy, Rial, Ryan, Sullivan, Shealds, Swiney,
Steele, Shannon, Timmons, Toole, Ward and Walsh.</p>

<p class='c030'>These are not all. Of the Murphys alone there were in the Williamsburg
district eleven families, nine Kellys and several distinct
families named O’Brian, O’Neil, O’Bannon and McCarty.</p>

<p class='c030'>We have selected only one of each name, in order to show that
the Irish settlements spoken of by Lossing, Sims and Ramsay were
drawn from the South, East and West, as well as from the North
of Ireland. American historians are in the habit of saying that the
immigrants from Ireland were mainly the so-called “Scotch-Irish”
element from the northern counties. While it is true there were
large settlements of Scotch Gaels in the Carolinas, it is seen from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the foregoing list that nearly every county of Celtic Ireland was
represented in the “hotbed of rebellion” of South Carolina.</p>

<p class='c030'>We see from the Census Returns that the collectors wrote down
the names phonetically in most cases, having paid little or no attention
to spelling, or the use of capital letters where they were needed.
Some peculiar transformations in names resulted from the carelessness
or ignorance of the enumerators. For instance, we find O’Neill
spelled “onailes” and “Ownaile”; O’Brien spelled “Obrient” and
“Obriant”; O’Farrell as “Opherl,” and Casey as “Caycey”; Donovan
is down as “Dunnevant” and “Dunnaphant”; Doherty as “Dehoitey”
and “Dohoty”; Nolan as “noling”; Sullivan as “Sellivent,”
“Swillevaun” and “Sewlovan”; Murphy as “Murff,” “Murph,”
“Murpry” and “Murfree”; Gallagher as “Gollerhorn”; Flynn as
“Phlyn” and “Fling”; Kinsella as “Kincheloe”; McLaughlin as
“Maklafflin”; O’Hara as “Oharroe”; and O’Ryan as “Orion.”</p>

<p class='c030'>To the prefix “Mac” the enumerators, in many cases, gave the
sound of “Mag.” Thus we have such name transformations as
“Magnamee” and “Magmanous.” We also find “Makmain” for
McMahon and “Muckleroy” for McElroy, and so on. Fitzgeralds
are down as “Fitzjarrel” and “Jarrel”; Fitzpatrick as “Fitchparterack”
and “Pitch Patrick”; Reilly as “Royley” and “Royalley”;
Cassidy as “Casaty.” In some Southern city directories we have
come across the name of “Pitch,” and we wonder if some of these
are not descendants of the “Pitch Patricks” or Fitzpatricks!</p>

<p class='c030'>It would be difficult to think of an old Irish name that is not
represented in the First Census, and which was not, at some time
or other, translated into something very different in appearance, and
sometimes only partially retaining the sound of the original name.
In the mutations of time, even these new names became still further
changed, so that many of the present-day descendants of the
Irish pioneers of the Carolinas cannot be recognized as at all of
the old Gaelic race.</p>

<p class='c030'>The most numerous Irish name on the First Census of South Carolina
is Murphy, there having been 50 distinct families of that name,
although the 48 Kelly families gave them a close race. The Gill
and McGill families run nip and tuck with the O’Neills and the
Nealls. There were 34 of the former to 33 of the latter. The
O’Briens and O’Bryans ran the gauntlet of many changes. The
Census enumerators failed to appreciate the significance of the regal
prefix “O,” so they wrote down the name Obrient, Obriant,
Bryan and Briant. There were 53 of these in South Carolina in
1790.</p>

</div>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>The Celtic “Macs” make a great showing. There are upwards
of one thousand of such families in all, the “Macs” that are indigenous
to Ireland being more numerous than those that are supposed to
be exclusively native to Scotland. When we consider that, in 1790,
the total number of free white males of 16 years and upwards in
South Carolina was only 35,756, we can readily understand that
one thousand heads of families, with their wives and children, must
have constituted a large percentage of the total population. An examination
of the Census Returns indicates that the average number
of children to each of the Irish-named families was five, so that, on
a conservative estimate, the “Macs” alone must have contributed
nearly 20 per cent to the population of South Carolina!</p>

<p class='c030'>We find 40 Ward families, 26 McClure families, 26 McDaniels,
23 McKees, 22 McCoys, 20 McDowells, 19 Cauleys and McCauleys,
19 Mahons and McMahons, 18 McCalls, 17 McBrides, 17 McConnells,
16 McCarts and McCartys, 12 McNeills, 11 McFaddens, and
10 McMullan families. There are also numbers of McCormacks,
McGees, McGowens, McGraws, McGuires, McCrackens, McCanns,
McCartneys, McCarys, McClearys, McClendons, McCollums, McElroys,
McKennys, McKelveys, McLaughlins, McManus, and many
other similar Irish family names.</p>

<p class='c030'>There are 41 distinct families of Bradleys recorded, 29 Harts, 24
Sullivans, 28 Reynolds, 22 Canes and Kains, 22 Hayeses, 22 Hendricks,
21 Dunns, 23 Connors and O’Connors, 21 Carrolls, 20 Logans,
20 Reillys and Royleys, 17 Dawsons, 14 Gilmores, 16 Manions
and Mannings, 12 Hagans, 13 Walshes and Welches, 13 Higginses,
and 11 Lynch and Linch families.</p>

<p class='c030'>Among names that are common to Ireland and England, there
are 113 families named Moore in the First Census of South Carolina,
80 Rogers and Rodgers, 24 Morrows, 46 Collinses, 42 Butlers
and 41 Fords. There are 43 heads of families named Mitchell, 41
Montgomery, 26 McDonald, 26 Cunningham, 18 Gillespie, 17 Cochran
and 22 Kennedy families, some of whom, no doubt, were Scotch.</p>

<p class='c030'>Such names as Brady, Burke, Casey, Connelly, Corbett, Cassidy,
Callahan, Cleary, Cummings, Curry, Daly, Doherty, Donnelly,
Dempsey, Dowling, Duggan, Doyle, Donovan, Ennis, Fitzgerald,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Fogarty, Fitzpatrick, Flinn, Garrett, Garvin, Gorman, Hogan, Jordan,
Kearns, Lyons, Malone, Mulligan, Madden, Morrison, Nolan,
O’Bannon, Quinn, Regan, Roach, Ryan, Rutledge, Shannon and
Shiels, as well as others of ancient Irish origin, occur quite frequently
in the Census Returns, and in all parts of the state. Indeed,
we might say, with startling frequency, if they are examined
by that set of persons who are so fond of telling us that the American
people are of Anglo-Saxon origin!</p>

<p class='c030'>Besides the old Irish clan names, it is seen that a very large number
of the early inhabitants of South Carolina bore names that
have been common in Ireland for centuries, although not all of
Irish origin. There are many Browns, Grays, Greens, Whites, Griffins,
Grimeses, Rices, Savages, Steeles, Glovers, Raineys, Rays,
Flemings, Staffords, Shaws, Gastons, Parnells, Mileses, Reeds,
Fergusons, Coxs, Courtneys, Clarks, Carrs, Kerrs, Allens, Pattersons,
Berrys, Hails, Henrys, Morrises, Martins, Lowrys, Hollands,
Morrows, Jacksons, Laceys, Masseys and Leonards.</p>

<p class='c030'>That some of these people were Irish seems beyond doubt, particularly
when we find such distinctive Irish Christian names as
Darby, Malachi, Patrick, Brian, Cormac, Connor and the like. And
when we see O’Bryan Smiths, Patrick Smiths, and Michael and Jeremiah
Smiths, and other similar name combinations, we can safely
assume that in the majority of cases they were of Irish origin or
birth.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>MEMORIAL TO JERSEY PRISON SHIP HEROES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c034'>Since many prominent Irish Americans played an important part
in the success of the project for a fitting memorial to the heroes of
the British prison-ships of the Revolution, it is fit that reference be
made here to this noble tribute and the manner of its accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c030'>The magnificent monument, costing in the neighborhood of $200,000,
was dedicated at Fort Greene Park, Borough of Brooklyn, New
York, on November 14, 1908, in the presence of one of the most distinguished
and representative gatherings which ever honored a like
occasion in this country. Addresses were made by President-elect
Taft, by Governor Hughes of New York, Secretary Luke E. Wright
of the Navy, and by other distinguished men, including Patrick F.
McGowan, Chairman of the Board of Aldermen of the City of New
York, and Daniel F. Cohalan, Grand Sachem of the Tammany Society
of New York, an organization which did much toward the success
of the project and which contributed a substantial amount.</p>

<p class='c030'>The monument itself is one of the finest memorials in the world.
It stands in the center of a broad plaza, reached by three flights of
34 steps each, 100 feet in width. The height from the bottom of
the plaza to the top of the monument is nearly 200 feet. The top
is accessible and is reached by an electric elevator. The monument
is constructed of white granite from New York state, and the steps
from granite quarried at Stonington, Penobscot Bay, Maine. The
architects were McKim, Mead and White, and the work is said to
have been the last of an extensive nature by the late Stanford White.</p>

<p class='c030'>The funds for the erection of this noteworthy tribute were obtained
through a government appropriation of half the amount, a
state appropriation of $25,000, an appropriation by the city of twice
that amount, and the rest through subscriptions from societies and
historical and patriotic organizations. The Tammany Society contributed
the final $1,000 to complete the required amount. This
well-known organization was the very first to secure a proper recognition
of the courage and patriotism of the prison ship martyrs
more than one hundred years ago.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Among the heroes of the British prison-ships were many of Irish
birth or extraction, and it is therefore a subject for pride and satisfaction
to us as a race that their valor has at last been recognized,
and especially that an organization largely controlled by our people
has played so important a part in the accomplishment of such recognition.
Never in the history of the world have prisoners of war been
made the victims of such unexampled cruelties as those practised on
the Americans by the British in the Revolution, and it is a striking
and never-to-be-forgotten commentary on British methods toward
their enemies in war that the record of the prison-ships of the Revolution
is deemed by all the world a black mark on English history.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>THE IRISH IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.</h3>

<p class='c028'><span class='sc'>Short Address Delivered by Master Karl Egan, at the Iowa
Opera House, Emmetsburg, Iowa, March 17, 1909, During
the Presentation of the Irish Drama, “The Hero of
Wicklow,” under the Auspices of the Ancient Order of
Hibernians. Some Facts of Interest to the People of
Irish Birth or Ancestry.</span></p>

<p class='c034'><em>Ladies and Gentlemen</em>: On this important anniversary, which is associated with so many achievements of interest to the people of our race, it is fitting to enquire what part the Irish took in the Revolutionary War. What did they do for the cause of human liberty at this most critical time in the world’s history? All we ask is the truth. For some reason our ordinary school histories have never given us any credit for the prominent part our ancestors took in
that great struggle. What I shall say will bear the closest historical
investigation.</p>

<p class='c030'>It was Patrick Henry, who, by his soul-stirring speech, aroused
the members of the Virginia Assembly to a sense of patriotic duty.
In 1776 he ran for governor on the Independence ticket and carried
that important colony for the Revolutionary cause. Still, he
claimed that John Rutledge of South Carolina was the greatest
American orator of his time. The latter was also elected president
of South Carolina in 1776, on the same ticket. John Rutledge and
Patrick Henry were both sons of Irishmen.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>During the Revolutionary War men of Irish birth or ancestry
served as governors in South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and New
Hampshire. They were among the most ardent and fearless of the
patriots of that history-making period.</p>

<p class='c030'>It was in John Duggan’s tavern in Boston that the Boston Tea
Party was planned. Several Irishmen were in the execution of the
plan.</p>

<p class='c030'>Eleven of the fifty-four members of the first Continental Congress
were Irishmen and sons of Irishmen. Thomas Johnson, who nominated
George Washington for commander-in-chief of the American
forces, was a Celt of the old school.</p>

<p class='c030'>The war began April, 1775, but it was not officially declared until
July 4, 1776. October 15, 1775, Congress sent a committee to
interview General Washington and to decide as to the advisability
of continuing the struggle. Of the five who participated in that
most important conference, Joseph Reed and Thomas Lynch were
Irish. The other members were Benjamin Franklin, Colonel Harrison
and General Washington.</p>

<p class='c030'>A rough draft of the Declaration of Independence was prepared
by Thomas Jefferson. It was re-written and carefully revised by
Charles Thompson, who was styled the Samuel Adams of Philadelphia,
and the life of the cause of liberty. When the Declaration
was first proclaimed, it was signed by John Hancock, as president
of the Continental Congress, and by Charles Thompson, as secretary.
The other names were attached later. Thompson was an
Irishman and Hancock an Irish American. John Nixon first publicly
read it and Thos. Dunlap first printed it and published it to
the world. Both were Celtic to the backbone. Who periled most
in signing the immortal document? History answers, Charles Carroll
of Carrollton, another Irish American.</p>

<p class='c030'>Who fought the hardest in the British House of Parliament for
the rights of American colonists? Edmond Bourk, an Irishman, and
one of the greatest statesmen the world has ever known.</p>

<p class='c030'>In placing his most important officers, General Washington had
Morgan and Hand leading his rifles, Knox at the head of his artillery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>John Dunlap as his life guard, Edward Hand as his adjutant-general,
Andrew Lewis as his brigadier-general, Stephen Moylan and
John Fitzgerald as his aids, and Ephraim Blaine as his quartermaster.
All were Irish by birth or ancestry. When Washington
was retreating through New Jersey, he sent word to Thomas Johnson,
a Maryland Celt, that he had not enough men to fight the British
and too few to run away with. Johnson raised a force of 1,800
men and hurried to his assistance.</p>

<p class='c030'>All students of American history have read of the gallant Richard
Montgomery, Mad Anthony Wayne, John Sullivan, Daniel Morgan,
Stephen Moylan, John Fitzgerald, Henry Knox, Wm. Irvine,
Richard Butler, and Generals Cochran, Campbell, McDowell,
McCall, McClary, Jasper, Graham, Hazelett, Colonel Pickens, and
many others who were among the most valiant and successful officers
in that eventful conflict. All belonged to our liberty-loving, heroic
race. It has been officially ascertained that out of 131 of the most
prominent officers in the war for American Independence, 20 were of
English ancestry, 25 of French, 10 of German and Dutch, 8 of
Scotch, 2 of Polish, and 84 of Irish and Welch. Commodores
Barry, Perry, McDonough and Stewart, of the wars of 1776 and
1812, were scions of brave-hearted exiles from the Emerald Isle.</p>

<p class='c030'>June 16, 1779, Joseph Galloway, speaker of the Pennsylvania
House of Representatives, who had to fly to England because of his
sympathy with the Tories, was examined as a witness by a committee
of the British House of Parliament, and he testified that the Irish
constituted one-half of the American army, the native Americans
one-fourth and that the other one-fourth were English and Scotch.
This statement is corroborated by Lecky, the English historian, Lord
Mountjoy, General Lee, Count Rochambeau, Col. J. C. Custis, the
adopted son of General Washington, and Rev. P. Allison, the Presbyterian
chaplain of Washington’s army. They are competent authorities.
President Roosevelt and James G. Blaine, in public addresses,
have acknowledged, in substance, the accuracy of this testimony.
Hutchinson, the last royal governor of Massachusetts, declared that
his colony would never have voted for independence, had it not been
for the rebellious Irish.</p>

<p class='c030'>There were 15 Irish in the battle of Lexington and 258 at Bunker
Hill. The monument at Bunker Hill is covered with Irish names.
Captain Parker, who commanded at Lexington, and who was killed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>was Irish. Colonels Barrett, Smith and Davis, who commanded at
Concord, were also Irish. When the American forces took possession
of Boston, John Sullivan was officer of the day and the countersign
was “St. Patrick.”</p>

<p class='c030'>After the treason of Benedict Arnold, General Washington ordered
that none but the Irish be placed on guard at West Point.</p>

<p class='c030'>When the soldiers of Lafayette were half naked and starving, the
Irish people of Baltimore, then a place of only one hundred homes,
gave them food and clothing. In 1780, when the finances of the
struggling republic were at the lowest ebb, when it took from $30
to $50 in paper to make $1 in specie, after our soldiers had suffered
at Valley Forge and elsewhere, the business men of Philadelphia
raised 315,000 lbs. sterling and gave it to Congress. Twenty-seven
Irishmen of that city contributed 103,500 pounds of that amount.
They were members of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, which gave
399 officers of the highest rank to the city, state and nation during
its early history. Washington became an honorary member of that
patriotic organization.</p>

<p class='c030'>When our country so badly needed assistance, Bishop Carroll accompanied
Benjamin Franklin to France to seek the aid of that
country. It was secured. History gives Franklin the credit, but
does not mention the name of Bishop Carroll, who really made the
mission a successful one. Bishop Carroll also accompanied Franklin
to the French Canadian provinces for a similar purpose.</p>

<p class='c030'>There were twelve Irish delegates to the convention that adopted
the Constitution, and there were five Irishmen in the first United
States Senate of twenty-two members.</p>

<p class='c030'>Dr. Hugh Knox educated Alexander Hamilton, who was a poor
boy. Doctor Knox was a big-hearted Irishman. It was Matthew
P. Lyon, an Irishman, who was sold as a slave in Connecticut when a
mere boy, who, on the thirty-sixth ballot, as a congressman from Vermont,
later in life, cast the deciding vote that elected Thomas Jefferson
president of the United States over Aaron Burr.</p>

<p class='c030'>Many who came with the French to assist the Americans were
sons of Irishmen, who had been driven to France with Patrick Sarsfield
after the treachery of the British at Limerick in 1691.</p>

<p class='c030'>From 1691 to 1791, over 400,000 different Irishmen served in the
French army. When the Revolutionary War broke out, they petitioned
the French War Department to come to America to fight their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>national foes. There were entire Irish regiments in the French army
when Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. A young Irishman,
Robert Wilson, was appointed to take charge of the surrendered
flags and the news of the great victory was sent in haste to President
Thomas McKean, of the Continental Congress at Philadelphia.
McKean was one of the foremost Irish Americans of his time.</p>

<p class='c030'>Molly Pitcher and Nancy Hart, two Irish women who participated
in the Revolutionary War, deserve rank with the greatest heroines
in history.</p>

<p class='c030'>The Irish were among the leading educators, journalists, theologians,
historians, scientists, canal constructors, and railway builders
of the decades subsequent to the Revolutionary War. They were
leaders in laying substantially the broad foundation for our material,
educational and moral greatness. They gave us such statesmen as
James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, John C. Calhoun, James K. Polk,
and many others, who were among the very ablest national leaders in
the early history of our republic.</p>

<p class='c030'>I shall not refer to the part the Irish took in the War of 1812,
the Mexican War, the great Civil conflict, or the Spanish-American
struggle for supremacy. All I ask is for you to reflect on their great
fight for liberty from 1775 to 1783—that struggle that has been felt
around the world—and to tell the facts to your children, to your
friends, and to your fellow citizens, for they will not, for some unknown
reason, find it in ordinary histories. I can do no better than
to quote, in closing, the words of Colonel John Parke Custis, the
adopted son of General Washington:</p>

<p class='c030'>“Then honored be the old and good services of the sons of Erin in
the war of independence. Let the shamrock be entwined with the
laurels of the Revolution; and truth and justice, guiding the pen of
history, inscribe on the tablets of American remembrance: ‘Eternal
gratitude to Irishmen.’”</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>HON. ELI THAYER, ONE OF THE EARLY MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY. A MOST DISTINGUISHED AMERICAN, KNOWN THE WORLD OVER. A FEW FACTS ABOUT HIS LIFE AND WORK.</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c033'>
    <div>BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>Hon. Eli Thayer was born in the town of Mendon, in the state of Massachusetts, June 11, 1819, and deceased at Worcester, in that state, April 15, 1899, aged eighty years.</p>

<p class='c030'>He was elected a member of the American Irish Historical Society
in 1897, shortly after its first meeting, and was an active and interested
member at the time of his death.</p>

<p class='c030'>Mr. Thayer was a descendant in the seventh generation from
Thomas Thayer and seventh in descent from John Alden of <em>Mayflower</em>
fame, through Ruth, daughter of Rev. Noah Alden of Bellingham,
Mass., who married his grandfather, Benjamin Thayer.
John Alden was an Irishman and Thomas Thayer was Irish on the
side of one of his parents.</p>

<p class='c030'>He was the eldest of eight children. He received his early education
in the district schools of Mendon, and at the Bellingham High
School. Later he attended the academy at Amherst and the manual
training school at Worcester, afterwards the Worcester Academy.
He always ranked high in his scholarship, and in 1835–’36 taught
school in Douglass, and for the four succeeding years assisted his
father in a country store at Millville. In May, 1840, he re-entered
the manual labor school, in order to fit for Brown University. Two
years later he taught school at Hopkinton, Rhode Island, and while
there was elected a member of the Phi Beta Kappa fraternity, an
honor seldom conferred before the senior year.</p>

<p class='c030'>In September, 1844, the superintendent of schools in Providence,
Nathan Bishop, induced him to take charge of the boys’ high school
for the remainder of the year for $600, a large salary for that period.
This school had proven for some time unmanageable in the hands
of several masters, but he reduced it to order and subjection. By accepting
this position, he lost a year at Brown University, but was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>able to graduate in 1845, the second in his class. After his graduation,
he immediately came to Worcester and became a teacher at
the Academy, and was later its principal.</p>

<p class='c030'>In 1845 he purchased of John Jaques four acres and ninety rods
of land in Worcester, on what was then called Goat Hill. In 1848
he began the erection of the building called the Oread, which was
completed in 1852. It is built of the stone underlying the hill.
At first only the north tower was completed, and it was in this portion
of the building that he established the famous school for young
women, which he conducted with great success until he entered upon
his later political work.</p>

<p class='c030'>At the time that the school was opened, it was the only institute
in the country that promised a full college course for women. It
was the forerunner of Vassar, Smith and Wellesley. The name
Oread means “the abode of the mountain nymphs.” The south
tower was completed in 1850, and the connecting portion of the
building a year or two later.</p>

<p class='c030'>The towers are 40 feet in diameter and four stories high, while the
entire length of the building is 250 feet. It was constructed after
designs entirely Mr. Thayer’s own, without the aid of an architect,
and the beauty of the building and the charming location have been
remarked by strangers from all over the country.</p>

<p class='c030'>He entered political life in 1852, when he was elected a member
of the school board. Later he was a member of the board of aldermen
and served during the years of 1853–’54 in the state legislature.
It was during his first year in the state House of Representatives
that he became conspicuous by the introduction of a bill to
incorporate the Bank of Mutual Redemption, which was hailed with
delight by bankers and monied men throughout the state, as it
seemed to afford a means of release from the autocratic rule of the
Suffolk Bank of Boston.</p>

<p class='c030'>This bill was passed in the course of years and the Bank of
Mutual Redemption loaned the money to the government when Andrew
was governor during the Civil War.</p>

<p class='c030'>It was not, however, until 1854 that Mr. Thayer accomplished the
great act of his life, the one which enrolls his name among the benefactors
of mankind, in originating the plan which saved Kansas and
other territories to the Union and perhaps settled the destiny of the
nation, for if the southern leaders had secured the territories, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>would have given them the balance of power for many years to come
and there would have been no rebellion. The North would have acquiesced,
as it always had, in the decision of the congressional majority.
In his original idea of making Kansas free, he actually
settled the destinies of the country.</p>

<p class='c030'>It was at a meeting to protest against the repeal of the Missouri
compromise, held in the old city hall on the evening of March 11,
1854, that Mr. Thayer announced his celebrated “plan of freedom.”
In effect it was simply to take possession by lawful means of the new
territories through organized immigration of free-state men sustained
by a base of supplies.</p>

<p class='c030'>Mr. Thayer defined this plan as “business anti-slavery,” distinguished
from sentimental and political anti-slavery, both of which
had been tried for many years and found to be faulty, slavery in the
meantime constantly growing stronger. He clearly saw that whichever
side gained the majority of the settlers would control the situations
of the new section, in spite of all efforts to establish others
among them, and to the purpose of securing this majority for freedom
he devoted all his energies and all of his means until that end
was accomplished.</p>

<p class='c030'>As the first means toward fortifying himself for this undertaking
he immediately secured the passage of an act to incorporate the Massachusetts
Emigrant Aid Company and before the vote to repeal the
Missouri compromise was taken, hired a hall in Boston and began to
speak afternoon and evening in behalf of his undertaking.</p>

<p class='c030'>The intense excitement and strong opposition which followed the
first announcement of the purpose to repeal the compromise in a
great measure subsided after that act was accomplished, and he
found extreme difficulty in the succeeding months in persuading a
sufficient number of men to join in his enterprise to form the first
colony.</p>

<p class='c030'>The Know-Nothing frenzy absorbed the public mind so fully that
other considerations were almost entirely excluded, and the Free
Soil vote of 1854 dwindled to a few thousands, the Republican candidate
for governor himself deserting his party and voting with the
native Americans. The Know-Nothing organization had controlled
the state for three years, and the frenzy had seized the public mind
to such an extent that no man who aspired to public office had a
chance of election unless he was affiliated with that party.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Every member of Congress belonged to it, and it has been commonly
said that Henry Wilson and other prominent office-holders of
that time were elected upon that platform. The national Know-Nothing
party did not agitate the slavery question, but maintained
that Congress ought not to legislate on the question of slavery, which
was regulated by the statutes of the various states.</p>

<p class='c030'>In 1856 the Republicans of the Massachusetts congressional district
in which Worcester is situated came to the front, but, feeling
that they stood no show of winning at the pending elections, made
alliances with the Know-Nothing party, whereby the offices were to
be divided, and Col. Alexander Dewitt made an agreement with
Henry Chapin that he would not run against him. At the last moment,
however, Governor Gardiner sent word that he must make the
run against Chapin. It was at this crisis that Charles White, a
party manager, nominated Eli Thayer for Congress, and took a carriage
and went to the Oread to notify him of his nomination.</p>

<p class='c030'>Mr. Thayer was warmly greeted in the convention and, although
it was but five days before the election, he announced his determination
to stump the district and called for means of transportation to
the various towns and villages. During the five days he made on an
average four speeches a day. At the close of the campaign Dr. Joseph
Sargent said to Mr. Thayer that no man could do what he had
done and live, but he replied that he was prepared to undertake the
same ordeal again in the same cause.</p>

<p class='c030'>During this campaign he would speak at Clinton in the morning,
at Leominster at noon, at Ashburnham in the afternoon and at
Fitchburg in the evening, and it was in this way that he covered the
entire Worcester district in the short space of five days. The result
of this bitter contest was most gratifying to Mr. Thayer, who won
by a vote of nearly two to one. The election was in November,
1856, but Mr. Thayer did not take his seat until the December of
the following year.</p>

<p class='c030'>At this time a new matter was interesting the southern members—the
retention of the state of Kansas in the Democratic column. The
notable southern propagandists, of which Quitman of Mississippi
was the representative, had, in order to amend the neutrality laws,
put on foot a scheme for the unification of Mexico, Cuba and Central
America and the formation of an immense slave empire. This
was regarded by the northern representatives with a great deal of
apprehension, but much to the surprise of everyone Mr. Thayer
came out in favor of it.</p>
<div id='i_227'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>MR. WILLIAM J. FARRELL.<br>  <br>  Of New York.<br>  <br>  A New Life Member of the Society.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>He said to the southern leaders that he intended to colonize this
new empire with New England Yankees. His speeches on Central
American colonization, on the “Suicide of Slavery,” and on the
“Admission of Oregon” brought him great fame. Against the caucus
decision of his own party he secured the admission of Oregon
into the Union, and in this act, though in opposition to partisan dictation,
he was sustained by leading Republican organs throughout
the country, although he received some censure in his own district.</p>

<p class='c030'>Soon after these speeches his political enemies in the district began
to organize against him, but his popularity was not to be overcome
and he was returned with a flattering endorsement. During his second
term in Congress he was instrumental in the admission of Oregon
as a state to statehood. The Republicans were of the opinion
that the admission of Oregon into the Union would mean heavier
Democratic representation. Mr. Thayer, however, argued that the
best way to make Oregon a Republican state would be to admit it
into the Union. Succeeding events proved that his view of the matter
was correct, but at the time the Republicans in the House opposed
the admission.</p>

<p class='c030'>Mr. Thayer, during the discussion of the bill, went to Alexander
H. Stephens, then chairman of the Committee on Territories of the
House, and told him that he should work for the passage of the bill
and it was to his everlasting credit that Oregon was admitted
to the Union by a majority of eleven votes, of which fourteen had
been won over by the untiring efforts of Mr. Thayer.</p>

<p class='c030'>He was assailed at home for his stand in this matter, as his constituents
considered that he had voted for a measure which provided
for the admission of a state whose constitution excluded the negro
from all political rights. As a direct result of his stand in this matter,
the district failed to send him as a delegate to the national convention
in 1860, which placed in nomination Abraham Lincoln for
the presidency.</p>

<p class='c030'>Together with Horace Greeley, however, he was a member of the
convention, representing Oregon, the state for whose admission he
had so earnestly worked, and whose people appreciated his services
in its behalf. He worked with Greeley for the nomination of Lincoln
in a convention which was replete with startling incidents, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the least of which was the motion of Joshua R. Giddings, aiming at
the admission of a clause in the platform providing that all men are
free and equal.</p>

<p class='c030'>On account of this outspoken stand in several important measures,
it was apparent to Mr. Thayer that he would fail of a renomination,
and in the spring of 1860 he announced himself as an independent
Republican candidate. As the campaign developed, a candidate in
opposition to Mr. Thayer was found in the person of Goldsmith F.
Bailey of Fitchburg, but no speaker in the state could be found who
was willing to meet the arguments on important questions advanced
by Mr. Thayer. Such men as Henry Wilson and Charles Sumner
refused to meet him on the stump in joint debate, and he was obliged
to fight it out alone. The result was that he was defeated by a very
small majority. So great was his popularity throughout the country
during his second term that he was prominently spoken of as a
possible senator from Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c030'>Bailey, who defeated him for Congress, was in advanced stages of
consumption when he was nominated and was unable to take the
stump against Mr. Thayer. The voters of Worcester at last became
so vigorous in their demands to see the candidate that to quiet them
a meeting was arranged at which he was to be presented to them
from the platform. When Bailey arrived in the city he was such a
haggard and ghastly spectacle that it was feared by the party managers
that if seen by the voters as he was, it would make votes for
Thayer.</p>

<p class='c030'>It is maintained by those who seem to know that Bailey was taken
into George R. Spear’s drug store before the meeting. There his
face was painted and touched up with cosmetics until he looked
like a thing of life instead of a specter. He sat in Congress but
one day, and then returned to his home and died.</p>

<p class='c030'>In 1856 Mr. Thayer originated a southern colonization scheme,
which had for its object the settling of Virginia, North Carolina,
Kentucky and the border states and driving the slaves toward the
Gulf. He enlisted the services of James Gordon Bennett of the
<cite>New York Herald</cite>, and William Cullen Bryant of the <cite>New York
Evening Post</cite> in his project. He went South at the head of the
colonists and founded the town of Ceredo in Virginia, now a sizable
place.</p>

<p class='c030'>At the time he was charged by the Southerners with coming down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>into the South to interfere with slavery, but he and his colonists disclaimed
any such purpose, saying that he neither intended to interfere
nor have any part in the slavery movement. He said further
that he could support the negro power and a steam engine for $10 a
year, while it was costing the southern slaveholders $150 a year, and
that at the time he came into Virginia land was worth but 50 cents
to $1.50 an acre, but that his free settlement had made it worth $50
an acre.</p>

<p class='c030'>A man named Jenkins, afterwards a rebel officer, appealed to
Gov. Henry A. Wise to exterminate this colony of abolitionists, but
the governor said that they came into the state in a peaceful way
and that anything which tended to increase the wealth should be
protected. Considerable progress with the colonization scheme was
made in other states, especially in North Carolina, but the John
Brown raid and the opening of the rebellion brought the enterprise
to an end. After the war Charles B. Hoard, a member of Congress
with Mr. Thayer, came into possession of the property at Ceredo.
The project caused Mr. Thayer a loss of $118,000.</p>

<p class='c030'>Mr. Thayer was appointed a special and confidential agent of the
treasury department and served as such in 1861–’62. In 1862 he
proposed to Secretary Stanton a plan for the military colonization
of Florida, which was approved by President Lincoln, all of the
members of the president’s cabinet excepting Seward, and by nearly
every Republican member of Congress, as well as by Generals Hunter,
Hooker and Garfield. According to the plan, Mr. Thayer was
to go as military governor and General Garfield as commander of
the forces.</p>

<p class='c030'>This plan was under consideration for several months by the
president’s cabinet and was sustained by great meetings in New York
City and Brooklyn by such speakers as William Cullen Bryant and
Cassius M. Clay and others of equal note. Capitalists came forward
with offers of steamships, and other means and regiments were
offered from several of the states, but, like other notable plans which
were never carried out, this plan was prevented from being put
into operation by exigencies of the times.</p>

<p class='c030'>He remained with the Republican party until the impeachment
of President Johnson. He was a Democratic candidate for Congress
in this district in 1874, and also later, in the first instance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>nearly defeating Senator George F. Hoar, reducing the Republican
majority from 7,000 to 300.</p>

<p class='c030'>He was interested in the solution of the polygamy question in
Utah, and, in connection with such men as Amos A. Lawrence, Edward
Everett Hale and other members of the old Emigrant Aid Society,
was concerned with plans for the elimination of the evil by
the principle formerly put into force in Kansas. In recent years
he has written much of history, illustrating his life work and the
principles which have governed his actions in political and philanthropic
work. He kept fully abreast of the times, with a keen interest
in current events, and was always in sympathy with genuine
progress.</p>

<p class='c030'>Mr. Thayer was engaged after leaving Congress by the Hanibal
and St. Joe Railroad Company, at a very large salary, to act as its
land agent in New York City. He was there from about 1864 until
1870. He was also an expert in matters of invention, acting as
a referee in such cases, for which he received large sums. He studied
law, but was never admitted to the bar.</p>

<p class='c030'>During the war time he originated a plan for the establishment
of a great port of entry on the peninsular between the York and
the James rivers in Virginia, and obtained a bond for a deed of the
land. He considered the natural advantages of that locality a rival
to New York. His plan, however, was divulged to certain heavy
capitalists in New York, and they by some means obtained possession
of the property and frustrated his scheme. He said he would
have carried the thing through had he obtained the land, but the
capitalists undertook it and failed.</p>

<p class='c030'>He had a very keen sense of humor and a sharp wit. It was most
amusing of itself to hear him tell humorous stories and preserve his
grim countenance from the suspicion of a smile.</p>

<p class='c030'>Mr. Thayer took the initiative in developing the south end of
Worcester for manufacturing by erecting, more than fifty years ago,
the building formerly known as the Adriatic mills on Southgate
Street. He was influential in the erection of the junction shop formerly
the property of the late Col. James Estabrook, and for many
years occupied by the Knowles loom works on Jackson Street. This
building, like the Oread Institute, was constructed of the stone
taken from Oread Hill. He laid out and improved several streets
and tracts of land in the vicinity of the Oread and had under consideration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>at the time of his death the opening up of a large area
on the summit of Pakachoag Hill, at the rear of Holy Cross College.</p>

<p class='c030'>He was the last surviving member of the Emigrant Aid Society,
director of the Mutual Redemption Bank, member of the Worcester
Society of Antiquity and the American Irish Historical Society.
Belonging to no clubs, he was essentially a home man. Throughout
the country he was familiarly known as the “Father of Kansas.”</p>

<p class='c030'>He was married in 1846 to Cardina M. Capron of Millville,
Mass., and seven children were born as a result of the union.</p>

<p class='c034'><span class='sc'>Pacific Blockade.</span> By <span class='sc'>Albert E. Hogan, LL. D.</span></p>

<p class='c030'>This is the only treatise in English exclusively upon this subject,
and the author has discussed a minor topic of international law fully
and fairly. His views are briefly that pacific blockade (the right to
blockade the ports of another state in time of peace and without war
necessarily resulting) is too new a practice to have become entirely
regularized; that the state blockaded as well as the blockader, but
not the third powers affected, may decline to look upon a specific
case of pacific blockade as consistent with peace, and thus consider
war to be a fact; that notice, effectiveness, days of grace, etc., are to
be observed much as in ordinary blockade; that, unlike ordinary
blockade, it may be limited to a certain commodity or a certain
traffic; that the ships of third powers, attempting to run a pacific
blockade, can only be turned back or at most detained, never seized
and confiscated as if war existed; that this kind of coercion is better
than war for all parties.</p>

<p class='c030'>This work is interesting throughout. Pinckney was not a great
constructive statesman, but in the work of the convention he rendered
valuable service in formulating many of the details embodied
in the Constitution. It was not so much a new instrument of government
that Pinckney framed in his original plan as it was a revision
of the Articles of Confederation. In the preparation of his
plan, Pinckney drew extensively upon the Articles of Confederation
and the various state constitutions, especially that of New York. On
May 29th, 1787, Charles Pinckney presented to the Federal Convention
“the draft of a federal government to be agreed upon between
the free and independent states of America”; that the records
note simply its submission to the convention, its reference on the
same day to the Committee of the Whole House, and later to the
Committee of Detail; and that when John Quincy Adams in 1818
applied to Pinckney for a copy of the missing plan, he received in reply
a document so strikingly similar to the draft of a constitution
reported by the Committee of Detail on August 6th that it was evident
one document must have been taken from the other. The
conclusion has been almost universally unfavorable to Pinckney.
Judge Nott in his work takes the other side, and in an elaborate argument
declares that the original Pinckney plan is lost to the world
because it was used as “printer’s copy” by the Committee of Detail.</p>

The volume now issued is the fifth, and covers part of the

his continued membership of the Committee on Foreign Relations

many of the most pressing questions of the time. The great issues
covered by these volumes were those of the northeastern and northwestern
boundaries and the annexation of Texas. In 1844 Buchanan
was a presidential possibility, and his letters, though few in
number, show him willing to take, but unwilling to seek, this high
office. An excellent review of these volumes has recently been

<p class='c030'>The author’s family were whalers from Nantucket. Mr. Merrick
is a good story-teller, and his book abounds with tales of traffic on
the Mississippi River from 1854 to 1863.</p>

<p class='c030'>The author originally came from Nantucket, and began as a
pantry boy on the Mississippi, occupying every position in the steamboat
and flat-boat business for a great many years, and his tales of
war-times are intensely interesting. The book is not well named,
however, because steamboating was a large business for over thirty
years before the narrative begins. He tells interestingly of bringing
to the front in April, 1861, Sherman’s Flying Artillery, the most
famous organization in the old army, stationed at the time at Fort
Ridgely, high up the Minnesota River. The <em>Fanny Harris</em>, the
largest boat which had ever gone up the stream, received the battery
on board, its commander then being no other than John C. Pemberton
of Pennsylvania, at first a loyal Union officer, although afterwards
the Confederate lieutenant-general at Vicksburg. His lieutenant
was Romeyn B. Ayres, than whom no Federal officer of the
Civil War was braver. The river was at flood, the perils of navigation
great, but the emergency was pressing. The <em>Fanny Harris</em>
dashed on at full speed, sometimes in the tortuous channel, sometimes
crashing through narrow barriers of land into inundated bottoms
and even woods, the battery-men meantime exclaiming that the risk
to life in battle was far less than among those pouring waters.
Three hundred miles down the current was accomplished in two days.
The boat was almost stripped of smokestacks, light upper work, and
nearly all of her guards, but the battery was delivered, guns and
men, at Prairie du Chien. Its style is simple, but very interesting,
and the book is beautifully illustrated and printed.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span><span class='sc'>Texts of the Peace Conferences at The Hague, 1899 and 1907</span>, with English translation and appendix of related documents. Edited by <span class='sc'>James Brown Scott</span>, technical delegate of the United States to the Second Peace Conference at The Hague.</p>

<p class='c030'>The volume is published by Ginn &#38; Company of Boston and New
York, of which our Librarian and Archivist, Mr. Thomas B. Lawler,
is a partner. There is a twenty-five page introduction, giving an
analysis and discussion of the work of the conferences. Most of
the documents have been published elsewhere, and some of them
many times, but it is well worth while to have them brought together
in this convenient form. Ex-Secretary Root thinks the work
of the Second Conference presents the greatest advance ever made at
any single time towards the reasonable and peaceful regulation of international
conduct, unless it be the advance made at The Hague
Conference of 1899. The volume is complete and treats of the important
factors in both conferences, and publishes the very valuable
documents.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='sc'>The Bibliographer’s Manual of American History</span>, containing an account of all state, territory, town and county histories, etc., compiled by <span class='sc'>Thomas Lindsley Bradford, M. D.</span></p>

<p class='c030'>Three volumes have thus far been issued, and each volume shows
improvement over its predecessor. It is a valuable work and a most
excellent compilation of documents of great advantage to students
of American history, and furnishes a good means of observation to
the members of the American Irish Historical Society to take in at
a glance the history of so many places in this country.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='sc'>The American Executive and Executive Methods.</span> By <span class='sc'>John H. Finley</span>, President of the College of the City of New York, and <span class='sc'>John F. Sanderson</span>, member of the Pennsylvania Bar.</p>

<p class='c030'>The joint authors of this book have maintained the high standard
of scholarship that has characterized the series of which the volume
under review is the final number. There are fourteen chapters upon
the executive department of the American state, and the other eight
deal with the federal executive, to which is added an appendix upon
the presidential electoral system. Throughout the work reference
is made to the excellent achievements of many Pennsylvania Irishmen,
but Mr. Marshall S. Brown, who prints a review of the work,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>finds, among other things, that the book reflects somewhat the defects
inherent in a work of dual authorship.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='sc'>Winthrop’s Journal, 1630–1649.</span> Edited by <span class='sc'>James Kendall Hosmer</span>. Two volumes.</p>

<p class='c030'>This is one of the series of “Original Narratives of Early American
History.” The old title, “History of New England,” is given
in this edition only as a sub-title, and the volumes appear to be what
they are—a journal. Nevertheless, the work is interesting throughout,
and would be a valuable addition to the Society’s library.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='sc'>The Province of New Jersey, 1664–1738.</span> By <span class='sc'>Edwin P. Tanner, Ph. D.</span>, instructor in history in Syracuse University.</p>

<p class='c030'>This is a detailed history of the political affairs and institutions
of New Jersey during two generations of its provincial life. The
peculiar land system of the proprietors in each of the two
Jerseys, elements of the population, the personnel, legal position and
activities of executive, council and assembly respectively, and their
conflicts, the judicial system, financial affairs, militia system, etc.,
are carefully treated.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='sc'>The Writings of James Madison.</span> Edited by <span class='sc'>Gaillard Hunt</span>.</p>

<p class='c030'>This is much on the plan and fully as extensive as “The Works
of James Buchanan” heretofore referred to, and eight volumes at
present have been issued. The notes are excellent in respect to information
and judgment, but not much of the matter set out is new,
the author merely contenting himself by copying the writings of
President Madison without making any specious comment on the
same.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='sc'>A Calendar of Confederate Papers, with a Bibliography of Some Confederate Publications.</span></p>

<p class='c030'>This is a preliminary report of the Southern Historical Manuscripts
Commission, and is one of the really monumental historical
enterprises in the South. The commission is actively collecting, arranging
and publishing various kinds of material relating to the
Civil War, and to thoroughly appreciate the truly marvelous changes
one should have known the conditions in the southern capitals a
quarter of a century ago. Those directing this enterprise are so
energetic, intelligent and ambitious that we believe the best fruits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>are yet to be gathered, although there is no room to doubt the value
of several large collections already made. Mr. Douglas Southall
Freeman is the director, and this calendar, orderly throughout and
supplemented by careful notes, is very complimentary to him. Much
historical data can be gathered for the Society from the southern
states, where the recognition of Irishmen and their achievements was
more free than in the New England states.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='sc'>The Adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.</span> By <span class='sc'>Horace Edgar Flack, Ph. D.</span></p>

<p class='c030'>Is a part of the Johns Hopkins University studies in historical and
political science. So much has been heretofore said about these
studies in the current magazines that we assume the members of
the Society are familiar with them.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='sc'>Collections and Researches Made by the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society.</span></p>

<p class='c030'>The Society has been at work many years, and now publishes its
thirty-sixth volume. The usefulness of this work to members of our
Society in Michigan who desire to record the history and achievements
of Americans of Irish birth or descent cannot be overestimated.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='sc'>Collections of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin.</span></p>

<p class='c030'>This is the eighteenth volume of the publications, and is edited by
Doctor Thwaites, Secretary and Superintendent of the Society. The
Wisconsin History Commission, consisting of the governor of the
state, the professor of American history in the state university, the
secretary of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, the secretary
of the Library Commission, and a representative of the Grand Army
of the Republic, work with the State Historical Society of Wisconsin,
and have already gathered and arranged the material for a
history of Wisconsin’s part in the Civil War. A series of “Original
Papers” has been inaugurated, on the line of the papers presented
at our last meeting in Washington by Mr. Justice Dowling and Ex-Attorney-General
Moloney, and are very interesting.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='sc'>Lives of the Governors of Minnesota.</span></p>

<p class='c030'>Is Volume XIII of the publications of the Minnesota Historical
Society Collections, and is by James H. Baker, A. M., who has occupied
several political positions in his state and has been closely
associated with the men whose lives he has sketched. Mr. Baker
is almost eighty years of age, and he has personal acquaintance with
the governors from Ramsey, the first territorial governor in 1849, up
to the present incumbent. Mr. Baker’s sketches of Gorman, territorial
governor from 1853 to 1857; Sibley, first state governor from
1858 to 1860; Swift, third state governor from 1863 to 1864;
McGill, 1887 to 1889; and Clough, 1895 to 1899; men of Irish extraction,
are thorough and entertaining.</p>

<p class='c030'>This is Volume X of the publications of the Society, and is edited
by the Secretary, George W. Martin. Fifty-six essays by nearly as
many writers are presented. Several of the productions are composed
of separate papers, such as the collections of biographical
sketches of members of early legislatures, etc. A wealth of original
material, well worth the notice of historians outside of the state of
Kansas, is revealed, and forty-eight maps, plans, portraits and landscapes
illustrate the text.</p>

<h4 class='c031'>GENERAL HISTORICAL ITEMS.</h4>

<p class='c032'>A very interesting document is the Report of the Committee on the
Documentary Historical Publications of the United States Government,
appointed by President Roosevelt in February, 1908, as
an assistant committee to the Committee on Department Methods.
Hon. Lawrence O. Murray, now Comptroller of the Currency at
Washington, D. C., and at that time in the Department of Commerce
and Labor, is a member of this committee, and the Society
acknowledges with its thanks the receipt from him of a copy.</p>

<p class='c030'>On February 11th, the President sent it to Congress with a message,
and message and report have since been printed as Senate
Document No. 714 of the session concluded March 4th.</p>

<p class='c030'>The report contains a review of the course hitherto pursued by the
government in the matter of historical publications; a general survey
of the publications hitherto made, and of the gaps still existing
between or among them; a body of recommendations for filling
such gaps, especially by the inception of a series of National State
Papers; and finally a series of suggestions for the organization of a
permanent Commission on National Historical Publications, with a
bill which, it is hoped, will be introduced in the sixty-first Congress.</p>

<p class='c034'>The Fifth Annual Meeting of the Pacific Coast Branch of the
American Historical Association was held at the University of California
November 21st last. Papers were read by Professor E. D.
Adams of Stanford University concerning the annexation of California,
Mr. Don E. Smith and Professor J. N. Bowman of the
University of California, and by Mr. F. J. Taggart. The proceedings
lasted the entire day, sessions being held in the morning and
afternoon, followed by a banquet in the evening.</p>

<p class='c034'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>The publications of the American Association for International
Conciliation are being sent forward to the members of our Society,
and are readable and interesting documents by learned authorities
upon the subjects they present. At the suggestion of the Secretary
of the Association, the addresses of our members were sent him, and
he has written each that the publications of the Association will go
forward to them if they so request it. All that it is necessary to do
to receive them is to write the Secretary. His address is: “F. P.
Keppel, Secretary, Sub-Station 84, New York City.”</p>

<p class='c034'>Hon. Thomas W. Bicknell, Providence, R. I., President of the
Rhode Island Citizens’ Historical Association and an applicant for
membership in our Society, has recently published in the Journal of
American History an interesting article entitled “First White Owners
of Land in America.” Mr. Bicknell is also the author of
“Sowans,” a work treating of the early history of Barrington and
Warren in Rhode Island.</p>

<p class='c034'>Among the contents of the last issue of the <cite>American Historical
Magazine</cite> is “Heroes of the Battle of Point Pleasant,” by Delia A.
McCulloch.</p>

<p class='c034'>In the January issue of the <cite>Essex Institute Historical Collections</cite>
is an article on “Captain John Manley of Marblehead, a Man of
Irish Descent,” by Robert E. Peabody.</p>

<h4 class='c031'>RECOMMENDATIONS.</h4>

<p class='c032'>It has been the custom of the Society since its organization to have
one annual meeting and two or more field days each year. The annual
meeting in each instance has been called for the early evening,
and the business affairs finished in a few minutes; then a short
reception would take place, followed by a dinner, on the completion
of which some historical papers would be read and addresses of interest
made.</p>

<p class='c030'>This proceeding is not calculated to sufficiently advance the interests
of the Society, or enable it to truly do the work for which
it is organized. Some historical associations have annual meetings
at which there is a morning and afternoon session, followed by a
dinner in the evening, while others have sessions lasting two or three
days. It is impossible to crowd into a single evening, part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>which has been taken up in partaking of a good dinner, any significant
number of historical papers, much less to have a discussion
on them.</p>

<p class='c030'>Valuable addresses have been made that have not been printed in
the Journal, and all that is left of them in the minds of the members
is hardly more than pleasant recollections of the speakers. All
the leading historical associations procure valuable papers from
members, and, after they are read, discussion upon the subject-matter
is thrown open, the good points gathered, and all reported
in print later for the use of the members.</p>

<p class='c030'>This Society could profitably take a day and an evening for its
annual meeting. A morning session should be had, called to order
at ten o’clock. Two or three papers could be read and discussion
had upon each, followed by a recess from one to three p. m. Further
papers and discussion might then be entertained and the meeting
adjourned, with all the business completely transacted, in time
for the dinner in the evening, at which short and interesting speeches,
good music and general recreation after the day’s work would be
in order.</p>

<p class='c030'>These annual conventions should take place in different parts of
the country, and those interested in our work will be sure to be on
hand. In looking over some of our old records, it appears that requests
have been made by members for meetings to take place in
Richmond, Va., Charleston, S. C., and Detroit, Mich. In neither
of these places has an annual meeting or a field day of the Society
taken place.</p>

<p class='c034'>Members of the Society are earnestly requested to furnish the Secretary-General
with correct addresses. When a member removes or
changes his address, the Secretary-General should be notified immediately,
otherwise the publications and communications of the Society
may be lost or fall into unauthorized hands.</p>

<p class='c034'>The necessity for prompt payment of dues ought to be manifest to
every member. The Society has no income except from the $5 a
year contributed by the annual members. No officer or member receives
any salary, and the finances are carefully and economically
managed by the Executive Council. We have no expense for
rental for the Society’s headquarters, and have no recent record of
any officer of the Society accepting even his traveling expenses in
matters connected with the Society. Nevertheless, the income is
small, and our expenditures for printing the annual volume, gathering
historical matter, postage, stationery and typewriting are large
and do not leave the Society at the end of the year with any substantial
balance in the Treasurer-General’s hands.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c034'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Donations of money or bequests by will or otherwise are earnestly
and respectfully solicited, and any member who will take the trouble
to read the constitution and note the purposes for which the Society
is incorporated can readily see the great and lasting service to our
people and American history in general that could be made, in addition
to what the Society is now doing, to make better known the
Irish Chapter in American History.</p>

<p class='c034'>Some members well able to pay are in arrears from two to four
years in their dues, notwithstanding the fact that several tactful
circulars and repeated statements have been forwarded them by
committees and officers of the Society. The attention of members is
called to section 8 of the by-laws, which reads as follows:</p>

<p class='c030'>“8. A member neglecting for two years to pay his annual fee shall
be notified of such omission by the Secretary-General. Still neglecting
for three months to pay the dues, such delinquent member
shall be dropped as no longer belonging to the Society.”</p>

<p class='c034'>Many of our members belong to other historical associations, and,
by keeping in touch with their works, become of greater service to
us. The American Historical Association, the headquarters of
which are at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D. C., and
the leading state historical associations are cordially recommended
to our members.</p>

<p class='c034'>Members are earnestly requested to furnish the Secretary-General
with biographical sketches. It is necessary to have these for our
archives, and we hope that no member will allow his feeling of
modesty to interfere with keeping the records of the Society complete.
These sketches will not be published in the Journal if a
member shall so direct. Read over your biographical sketches in
the membership roll, and if they are not correct or should have additions,
notify the Secretary-General.</p>

<p class='c034'>Current items of interest relating to the doings of Americans of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Irish extraction are solicited from every member by the Secretary-General.
If a good article is met with in a newspaper or magazine,
it will be thankfully received and filed in the archives if you will
send it forward. It is by keeping abreast with the current history
that we fulfil one of our greatest duties.</p>

<p class='c034'>Donations of historical works, ancient or modern, or, in fact,
books of any description, are solicited for the Society’s library.
Copies or originals of old deeds, wills, bills of sale of slaves, curiosities
in American or Confederate money, plate, postage stamps, old
prints, pictures and the like are also solicited. When received, they
will be carefully indexed and filed, with the name of the donor attached.
Every member can readily find something of interest to
send, and the aggregation will form a nucleus for a good library and
possibly a museum.</p>

<p class='c034'>Volumes I, II, IV, V and VI of the <span class='sc'>Journal</span> of the Society are
out of print. We have fifty copies of Volume III and ten copies of
Volume VII left. The Executive Council have ordered fifteen hundred
copies of Volume VIII, so that we may be sure every member
will have a copy and the Society have some to spare.</p>

<p class='c030'>These volumes out of print have become very rare, and some of
them are held at high prices. If a sufficient demand appears from
members who desire to have a complete set of the Society’s publications,
the subject will be brought before the Executive Council for
action, with the possibility that some of the volumes may be ordered
reprinted.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS SANDERS, ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY, AND MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL. A WORTHY AND DISTINGUISHED ASSOCIATE.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c033'>
    <div>By <span class='sc'>A. W. Van Hoose, president brenau college-conservatory, gainesville, ga</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>On August 3d, 1908, there died at his home in Gainesville, Ga., one of the most remarkable men that it has been my good fortune to meet.</p>

<p class='c030'>Descended on his father’s side from Rev. Moses Sanders, a Baptist
preacher who emigrated from England to this country in the
year 1765, and on his mother’s side from Thomas Smythe, a man
distinguished for his great learning and for the many sweet poems
that came from his pen, an Irishman, who with a party of friends,
left Dublin, Ireland, in 1798 and made his home in Charleston,
S. C., Colonel Sanders combined in his nature, disposition and temperament,
the very best characteristics of the English and Irish,
whose descendant he was.</p>

<p class='c030'>For twenty years I knew him intimately, and I have no hesitation
in making the statement that he was one of the most remarkable
men of the generation in which he lived.</p>

<p class='c030'>If I were asked in what respects he was remarkable, I would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>answer, First in his broad patriotism and deep love of country. Although
he was little more than a boy when Georgia, in which state
his parents had settled, seceded and issued her call for her sons to
take up arms in defense of principles which they knew to be right,
young Sanders, who had received a splendid military training at the
Georgia Military Academy, was one of the first to respond to his
country’s call, and during all those years of carnage and bloodshed,
he gave his best strength, mental and physical, to the cause of the
Confederacy. For distinguished bravery and great ability in military
matters, he was soon made Colonel of the 24th Regiment of
Georgia Volunteers and in the battles of Williamsburg, Seven Pines,
Cold Harbor, Malvern Hill, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Harper’s
Ferry, The Wilderness, Spottsylvania Court House and other
great struggles, the Confederacy had no braver soldier or more efficient
officer than he. At Spottsylvania, he was severely wounded
and his command suffered greatly; he was captured at Sailor’s Creek,
May 6, ’65, and until July 25th, suffered the awful horrors of the
Federal Prison at Johnston’s Island. During the war, he was offered
the rank of Brigadier-General, but with that modesty which
characterized his whole life, he declined the honor.</p>

<p class='c030'>While he loved the cause of the Confederacy with all the ardor
of his great soul, when Lee surrendered at Appomatox, Colonel
Sanders ceased fighting and applied himself diligently to building
up the waste places of his beloved country and to making a competency
for himself and family, and the great success which attended
his efforts in both instances is the second reason that I would assign
for calling him a remarkable man. In 1871, he married Miss Fannie
Amelia Scarborough, who until the day of his death, was a blessing
and an inspiration to him. Together they came to Gainesville,
a little mountain village, in 1871, immediately after their marriage,
to build their home and fortune. By industry, economy and great
business ability, Colonel Sanders succeeded in amassing a splendid
estate, and at the same time was always first in his contributions to
any public enterprise or private charity. No one will ever know
how many cases of distress he relieved; for he obeyed the Scriptural
injunction and never allowed his left hand to know what his right
hand was doing. The writer of this sketch, was often at the State
Bank, of which Colonel Sanders was President for many years, and
has seen numbers of the old veterans, unfortunate men of all classes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>and even the negroes of the city, ask for aid and never once were
they refused. On the day that he died, I heard numbers of men,
with tears in their eyes, say, “I have lost the best friend that I ever
knew”; his funeral services were attended by every class of people
in our city and country, and after his more intimate friends came
and with streaming eyes looked into the face of him who had befriended
them for so long. Such a funeral has been accorded but
few men in our country. Colonel Sanders was also remarkable for
his literary and scientific attainments. Although he professed to
be only a business man, he was a great student of men and affairs;
he was a great reader of history and the record of all nations, from
the earliest period to the present day, was an open book to him;
he had traveled extensively and the literature and civilization of Europe
and Egypt and the Holy Land, were so fully and accurately
impressed upon him, that he could entertain his friends by hours in
recounting his experience as a traveler. But best of all, Colonel
Sanders was remarkable in his childlike devotion to and faith in
Jesus Christ, the Man of Galilee, in whose footsteps he had followed
for many years. He was one of the very few men of my acquaintance
who, though devoted to his business, always kept a Bible
in the President’s office of the State Bank, and oftentimes have I
called to see him only to find him immersed in the beauties of the
great prophecies of Isaiah, or reading the Songs of David, the sweet
singer of Israel, or studying the life and character of Him who
came into the world to save men from their sins. For years, he was
a pillar in the Baptist Church of this city; he always taught a class
in Sunday School and his presence there was always an inspiration
to the Superintendent. During an intimate acquaintance for more
than twenty years, I do not think that I ever heard him speak an
unkind word of any one and when the summons came, his house was
in order and he was ready to meet his Master and give an account
of the deeds done in the body. I was with him very often during his
last illness and his faith in the promises of Him whom he had
served so long and so faithfully, was beautiful and sublime. Not
a word of business care or anxiety was heard around the sick bed
of Colonel Sanders; he seemed in constant communion with God,
and though he had large financial interests, in these last days he
made no mention of them.</p>

<p class='c030'>To the writer of this sketch, his death was a great personal loss;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>when I began the work of building a school for girls in Gainesville
nearly twenty-five years ago, Colonel Sanders was my friend and supporter;
during all the years of struggle and trial in the early days
of the school he gave me the benefit of his advice and counsel and
never refused any financial assistance when called upon to extend it.
It was his confidence in a struggling young man that often nerved
my arm and heart to continue the work which I had undertaken.
And when the end had come, and I looked upon that face, calm and
sweet, having the appearance of one who had only fallen asleep, I
thought of the words of the great poet and said to myself:</p>

<h3 class='c001'>PATRICK J. McTIGHE.</h3>

<p class='c034'>A worthy member of the American Irish Historical Society was
deceased at Binghamton, N. Y., August 4, 1908.</p>

<p class='c030'>Patrick J. McTighe was born in Kilrush, County Clare, Ireland,
in 1840, and received his education in a university at Dublin. His
parents arrived in this country about fifty-five years ago, settled in
Binghamton and were among the few pioneer Irish Catholic residents
of that section. About forty-five years ago Mr. McTighe followed
his parents to Binghamton and secured a position as teacher
in one of the public schools. After teaching about two years he entered
the employ of the wholesale grocery firm of Jackson, Denton
&#38; Marks. This firm changed several times and many different partners
were admitted and retired while Mr. McTighe was connected
with the business.</p>

<p class='c030'>Following are a few of the firm names which the original house
passed through before Mr. McTighe acquired the present business:
Jackson &#38; Marks, Marks &#38; Bean, Bean &#38; Company, McTighe,
Truesdell &#38; Davidge. Mr. McTighe was a silent partner in the
firm of Bean &#38; Company, and was an active partner in the firm
which he later bought out and reorganized under the present name
of the McTighe Grocery Company, with offices and warehouses at
No. 69 Fayette Street.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Mr. McTighe had been prominent in political, religious and social
circles in this city for many years. In addition to his membership
in the American Irish Historical Society, he was a member of
the Catholic Club of New York, the Knights of Columbus, and
many other orders and societies. He was president of the local
branch of the old Land League during the season of its most effective
work; a former president of the Binghamton Board of Trade
for several years, and was a police commissioner of that city. During
the presidential election of 1892 Mr. McTighe served as a presidential
elector when Grover Cleveland was made president.</p>

<p class='c030'>He had been a devout communicant and a member of the board of
trustees of St. Patrick’s Church since the time when this church was
the only Roman Catholic edifice in Binghamton. Aside from being
a moving spirit in the church proper he took a lively interest in
the many branch societies of St. Patrick’s.</p>

<p class='c030'>He is survived by his widow, whose maiden name was Miss Mary
A. McDonald; two sisters, Mrs. Anne Wall and Mrs. Mary Murphy;
a nephew and a niece, John and Florence McDonald, whom he
brought up from childhood as his own children; two nephews, Patrick
and John McTighe; and two nieces, Frances McTighe and
Elizabeth Wall.</p>

<p class='c030'>Mr. McTighe always kept green his memories of the “Ould Sod,”
and was in touch with all movements to better the condition of the
Irish people. His recent efforts to aid the Kerry fishermen were
especially praiseworthy.</p>

<p class='c030'>Mr. McTighe was the leader in the movement to raise the fund
raised in Binghamton to aid the Quilty fishermen, who rescued
the sailors of the <em>Leo XIII</em> last autumn. The editor of <cite>The
Binghamton Press</cite> was made treasurer of the fund, in recognition
of the sermonette editorial, based upon the thrilling story of the
wreck, while Mr. McTighe took active charge of raising the money
and sending it to Ireland.</p>

<p class='c030'>In business Mr. McTighe was a hard worker and a keen, methodical
business man. He had the reputation everywhere of having a
very high regard for his word. In his long life and connection
with the grocery business he was associated with many of the pioneers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>of Binghamton business life and many of the old aristocrats of
the business circle.</p>

<p class='c030'>He was a well educated and well read man, being a scholar in
Latin, Spanish, Celtic and French. He was always improving his
mind, and, it is said, started in to learn Greek when past the age of
sixty, finally mastering it so that he read it with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c030'>The decease of this estimable man has left vacant a place hard to
fill, and the entire city of Binghamton was filled with sorrow at his
sudden death.</p>

age, and spent much of his youth at East Dennis, Cape Cod, Mass. His
early love for the sea was gratified later in life when he became captain
of some of the finest deep-water ships sailing from Baltimore, Boston and
elsewhere. His first command was the bark <em>May Queen</em>, a regular Baltimore
and Rio packet, 1872. He then had command of the ship <em>Pilgrim</em>
of Boston, and made several voyages to the East Indies. In 1884 he was
given command of the <em>Charger</em>, a larger and finer ship than the <em>Pilgrim</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>and sailed to ports in Japan. He next had command of the <em>South American</em>,
“the commodore’s ship,” of the Hastings fleet (Boston), and took
her to Australia and other parts. He made several record voyages during
his career, and some of these records still stand, having never been
equalled. On one occasion he was wrecked off the coast of Africa; he
and his wife upon being rescued were hospitably entertained by the Boers
of the adjacent country. Returning to East Dennis, Mass., his wife’s
health became poor and so he removed with her to Coronado, Cal., hoping
that the change of climate would benefit her, but she died in 1901. She
had accompanied her husband on several of his voyages, and had with
him visited many parts of the world. Captain Connolly has written much

ocean life entitled “The Magic of the Sea”; is Vice-President of the Society

and contractor; was educated in the national schools and remained in
Ireland until his eighteenth year, arriving in Wilmington, N. C., March
28, 1878, where he has since resided. He entered the commission business,
and in due course became a partner in the firm of W. I. Gore &#38; Company;

which had largely increased, was incorporated under the name and
style of The Corbett Company, under which the business is now conducted.

for his success in life. The union has been signally blessed, ten children
having been born to them, nine of whom are still living. Is Vice-President
of the Society for North Carolina.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Cosgrove, Hon. James</span>, was born at Charleston, S. C., Aug. 28, 1861. His
father, a native of Bally Connell, County Cavan, Ireland, settled in
Charleston in February, 1839; became a prosperous merchant; was one
of the aldermen of the city for two terms and one of the Representatives
from Charleston County in the General Assembly of South Carolina in
1874–’75. His mother was Catherine Daily. The family have been
Charlestonians for over seventy years and during this period father and
son have been closely identified with the commercial and political life
of the community. Mr. Cosgrove attended first a private school, then the
parochial school attached to St. Finbar’s Cathedral and later the high
school of Charleston, where he was graduated at the age of sixteen years.
He then went into his father’s office and later established himself in the
real estate and general insurance business, which he still successfully
conducts. About twenty years ago he became interested in the experiments
conducted by Sir Patrick Manson, an Irishman, Leveran, a Frenchman,
and the Italians Celli, Golgi and Bignam, concerning the inoculation
of the human body with the virus of malaria fever by the bite of a species
of the mosquito known as the “Anopheles.” He followed the investigations
closely and as a result of what was proven commenced agitation for the
drainage of wet and low lands of the United States, to remove breeding
places of this species of insect. At that time there was a “death line”
around the coastal section of the Southern States and many other sections
of the United States, within which line it was thought to be dangerous to
live in the summer for fear of malarial fever. At first his efforts met
with poor success, and in 1898 he determined to become a candidate for
the State Legislature to have enacted legislation necessary for the proper
and systematic drainage of the wet lands of South Carolina. He was
re-elected in 1900, but such was the opposition to the new movement
that not until 1902 did he succeed in having created for Charleston County
“The Sanitary and Drainage Commission.” Indeed, it required a man of
the most untiring industry and indomitable will to have successfully carried
his purpose during these four years of antagonism. The work of
sanitary drainage in Charleston County was commenced under the direction
of this commission, but it was soon found that it absolutely required
some one to take the direction of the work who would be willing to sacrifice
his self-interest for the good of the public. The commissioners,
comprising some of the best citizens of the city, with one accord turned
to Mr. Cosgrove and requested him to take entire direction. He did so,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>and has since remained in charge. The result is that thousands of acres
of fertile lands have been made habitable, affording dwelling places,
and manufacturing enterprises have been inaugurated, affording employment
to thousands on land, which a few years ago was worthless. In
1902 Mr. Cosgrove was defeated for re-election by a small majority, owing
to opposition to the idea of drainage. He determined to retire from
politics, but in 1906, answering the call of his people as voiced in leading
editorials in the press of Charleston, he consented to again become a candidate
and was elected by a flattering vote and re-elected by a still larger
vote in 1908. He is chairman of the Charleston Delegation in the House
of Representatives and chairman of the Committee on Banking and Insurance.
Mr. Cosgrove’s efforts in behalf of the drainage of the low
lands of the United States have been recognized by his appointment as
member of the Executive Committee of the National Drainage Congress
and Honorary Vice-President of the Seventeenth National Irrigation Congress.
As a corollary of his drainage work, Mr. Cosgrove has been giving
much attention to the subject of good roads, and has now on the
calendar of the Legislature a measure providing for state aid to the
building of good roads. In 1885 Mr. Cosgrove was married to Miss
Mathilde Griffith Forsythe, daughter of a prominent and wealthy dry
goods merchant of Charleston.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Davies, William Gilbert</span>, 32 Nassau Street, New York City, son of Henry
E. Davies and Rebecca Tappan Davies, was born in New York City,
March 21, 1842. He received a collegiate education at Trinity College,
Hartford, Conn., from which he graduated in 1860. He also studied at
the University of Leipsic, Germany. Mr. Davies read law with Slosson,
Hutchins and Platt, and was admitted to the bar in May, 1863, and at
once entered earnestly upon the pursuit of the profession his father had so
greatly adorned. During the Civil War, then raging, he served in the
Twenty-second Regiment, New York Militia, during the Gettysburg campaign.
Mr. Davies’ first partnership in practice was formed with Henry
H. Anderson, but on August 1, 1866, the partnership was dissolved, and
Mr. Davies entered the service of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of
New York. The law department of that corporation was fully organized
in September, 1870, with Mr. Pruyn as solicitor and Mr. Davies as his assistant.
He remained in that position until May 20, 1885, at which time
he became the head of the department. During the succeeding quarter of a
century Mr. Davies, as counsel for one of the leading insurance companies,
was largely instrumental in establishing rules of law on insurance matters
as they exist today. He resigned in December, 1893, in order to resume
the active practice of his profession. He was one of the commissioners
on the widening of Elm Street, New York, and extending the
street from Great Jones Street to the City Hall. Mr. Davies joined the
American Irish Historical Society in 1898 and is a member of the New

Century Association, and the Union University Lawyers, Manhattan,
Tuxedo, Grolier, Democratic and St. Nicholas Clubs. He belongs also
to the American, New York State, and New York City Bar Associations,
and the Law Institute. He was married in 1870 to Miss Lucie Rice,
daughter of Hon. Alexander H. Rice, who was three terms governor of
Massachusetts. He resides at 22 East Forty-fifth Street. Mr. Davies is

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Dixon, Richard</span>, insurance, 52–54 William Street, New York City.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Dixon, Samuel Gibson</span>, M. D., LL. D., Bryn Mawr, Pa., was born of Quaker
parentage in the city of Philadelphia in the family homestead below Bartram’s
Botanical Gardens, March 23, 1851. His early education was received
at the Friends’ Schools in that city and was supplemented by
private tutors, by whom he was prepared for Harvard College. His
health failing, however, he went abroad for recreation and study. Returning
home he set himself to acquire a thorough knowledge of business principles,
taking a course at the Mercantile College. On the conclusion of
this he studied conveyancing under the late Edward Bedlock of Philadelphia.
He then studied law in the office of his brother, Edwin Saunders
Dixon, Esq., attended the law course of the University of Pennsylvania,
and was admitted to practice at the bar of Philadelphia June 30, 1877,
continuing in the active practice of that profession for ten years. The
practice of law left him with trusteeships of importance which have necessarily
kept him well to the front in affairs. Under the stress of desk and
office work his health again failed, and his tastes inclining him to make
a hobby of scientific medicine he matriculated in the Medical Department
of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, from which he
was graduated with honor in 1886. While still an undergraduate, however,
he received the unusual compliment of an appointment by the trustees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>to the position of Assistant Demonstrator of Physiology. During his
last year in the medical school he suffered from a serious attack of typhoid
fever, which made a foreign trip again desirable in the opinion of his
physicians. Being greatly interested in the infant science of bacteriology,
as soon as his strength permitted, he entered the Bacteriological Department
of King’s College, London, from which he was graduated. He also
took a course in the College of State Medicine, London, under Professor
Klein, and it was while prosecuting observations under that master in
bacteriology that he made the discovery of branched forms of tubercle
bacilli hitherto unnoticed. He also studied under Pottenkofer, in
Munich, and made a careful study of the methods of filtration of water
and disposition of sewage then in vogue in the capitals of Great Britain
and Europe. Returning to Philadelphia in 1888, his alma mater recognized
the value of his attainments by appointing him the first Professor
of Hygiene in the newly created chair in the Medical Department, and
also Dean of the Auxiliary Department of Medicine. While in this position
he embraced the opportunity to establish the first Laboratory of
Hygiene in the University. Two years later he resigned these positions
to accept the appointment of Professor of Bacteriology and Microscopical
Technology at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, of which
institution he became Executive Curator in 1892 and President in 1896.
During this period his mind reverted constantly to the problem of the
branched tubercle bacillus and the possibility which he had conceived of
obtaining immunity to that disease by the introduction into the human
economy of attenuated bacilli or of fluid extracts from the same, and
he prosecuted original researches on this subject untiringly. On October
19, 1889, he published in the <cite>Medical News</cite> of Philadelphia the results
which he had then reached in producing immunity to that disease
in the lower animals, and has constantly kept the profession informed of
his investigations by means of addresses and contributions to medical
and scientific journals. The two theses or propositions on which he based
this theory of possible immunity to the tubercle bacillus are as follows:
“First. It is possible that by a thorough filtering out of bacilli from
tubercular material a filtrate might be obtained and attenuated so that
by systematic inoculations a change might be produced in living animal
tissues that would enable them to resist virulent tubercle bacilli. Second.
To bring about a chemical or physical change in living tissues
that would resist tubercular phthisis it is possible that inoculations with
the bacillus would have to be made; yet, before this could be done, the
power of the virulent bacilli would have to be diminished; otherwise the
result would be most disastrous.” In the autumn of 1890, Doctor Dixon,
inspired by the announcement of Professor Koch that he had succeeded
in developing a substance which possessed the power of preventing the
growth of the tubercle bacillus in the human economy, again visited
Europe in order to assure himself of the accuracy of the reports and in
the interest of humanity as well as of the various scientific and medical
institutions with which he was connected, and had interviews with Koch,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Virchow and Dubois Raymond. That Doctor Dixon has always recognized
the claims of the community as a whole on members of his profession
is sufficiently proven by the fact that he is officially connected
with so large a number of scientific, philanthropic and educational institutions.
He has been for eighteen years Executive Curator of the
Philadelphia Academy of the Natural Sciences, and for fourteen years
its President. For a number of years he was a member of the Board of
Education of the city of Philadelphia an as Chairman of the Committee
on Hygiene devoted much time to improving the sanitary condition
of the schools. He is an officer of the Ludwick Institute, the Society
for the Prevention of Tuberculosis in Pennsylvania, the Zoological Society
of Philadelphia and the Grandom Institution, a member of the
Council of the American Philosophical Society and of the Historical Society
of Pennsylvania, a director of the Wistar Institute of Anatomy of
the University of Pennsylvania, a Fellow of the College of Physicians
of Philadelphia, a member of the American Medical Association, the
Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia County
Medical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science
and the American Archeological and Asiatic Society, and one of
the originators of the Geographical Society of Philadelphia. An enthusiast
on field sports from his early boyhood, many of his vacations have
been spent in salmon and trout fishing and the hunting of big game. He
has been an enthusiastic and successful breeder of choice cattle and sporting
dogs. He is a member of the American Kennel Club, of which he was
the first Secretary, and President of the Philadelphia Kennel Club. Among
the social clubs of the country he is a member of the Philadelphia Club,
the Merion Cricket Club, the University Club, the Tarrantine Golf Club
and the Radnor Hunt.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Doyle, John F.</span>, of John F. Doyle &#38; Sons, 45 William Street, New York
City. (Life member of the Society and a member of its Executive Council.)
Mr. Doyle is the senior member of the real estate firm of John F.
Doyle &#38; Sons. He was born in New York City, 1837, a son of James
Doyle, who participated in the Irish revolution of 1798, and who came
to the United States early in 1806. This James Doyle, the immigrant, had
a son who was killed in the Florida war of 1837, and a grandson who fell
in 1861, fighting for the Union. John F. Doyle, the subject of this sketch
and member of the Society, entered the law office of Alexander Hamilton,
grandson of the first Secretary of the Treasury, afterwards the
firm of Hamilton, Rives &#38; Rogers, and remained with them from 1853
to 1869, in the meantime studying law and being admitted to the bar in
1862. Alexander Hamilton, Francis R. Rives, a son of William C. Rives,
of Virginia, at one time minister to France and senator, and Nathan Pendleton
Rogers, all of the old Revolutionary stock, were members of the
firm. Mr. Doyle’s management of some Wall Street properties for
them at this period became so conspicuous that he was urged by them
to assume the management of their estates, which he did. Shortly afterwards
followed the acquisition of the estates of such well-known people
as Mrs. Harriet L. Langdon, granddaughter-in-law of the first John Jacob
Astor, John Pyne March, Mrs. Morgan L. Livingston, George L.
Schuyler, James M. Pendleton, A. Newbold Morris, James H. Jones, John
Steward, Jr., Royal Phelps, deceased, Royal Phelps Carroll, Robert S.
Minturn, estate of Gertrude L. Lowndes, deceased, William H. King,
of Newport, R. I., and others too numerous to mention in detail. A
feature of his career as a successful manager lies in the fact that the
business associations and connections formed by him in the beginning
are still held intact. Among the notable sales made by him are those
from William H. Morris to John Jacob Astor in 1880 conveying 150
acres of lots in the twenty-third ward on and adjacent to Harlem River;
the great sale of South Brooklyn lots at Gowanus Bay in 1884. Mr. Doyle
represents today the same old and well-known families and estates represented
by him so many years ago. During his career Mr. Doyle has
met and done business with some of the most notable men connected with
families famous in American history, such as three of the four sons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>of the first Alexander Hamilton, Admiral Farragut, Capt. Percival Drayton,
Rawlins Lowndes, of South Carolina, William C. Rives, U. S. senator
from Virginia, at one time minister to France, George L. Schuyler,
grandson of Philip Schuyler, and owner of the famous yacht <em>America</em>,
Philip Schuyler, his son, Henry Grinnell of Arctic fame, Robert J. and
Mortimer Livingston, Hon. John Lee Carroll, Commodore Wm. K. Vanderbilt,
and scores of others equally well known, besides representing
branches now of four lineal descendants of signers of the Declaration of
Independence. His two sons, Col. John F. Doyle, Jr., and Alfred L.
Doyle, have been with him in business for years past and all three enjoy
an enviable reputation for integrity, ability and prudence in all their
undertakings.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Flynn, Col. David M.</span>, Princeton, N. J., is cashier of the First National
Bank of Princeton. He is probably the youngest officer in the National
Guard of New Jersey to hold the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, being only
thirty-three years of age, born in Princeton in 1876. In the Guard, as
well as in business life, Colonel Flynn has come up from the ranks. He
was one of the moving spirits in the organization of Company L of the
Second Regiment, which has distinguished itself on the rifle range at
Sea Girt. He enlisted in the company as a private in 1900; was made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>a corporal in 1901, battalion sergeant-major in 1903; re-enlisted in 1905;
was made captain and paymaster of the Second Brigade by Colonel Collins
December 10, 1906; major and paymaster, Second Brigade, December
10, 1907, and major and inspector of small arms practice, July 9, 1908.
Colonel Flynn’s success in a business way has been as remarkable and
gratifying as his military success. Owing to the death of his father, he
began work in a store at the age of thirteen, where by his industry and
integrity he attracted attention to himself. He studied at night, and
when nineteen years of age passed a United States civil service examination,
and was named registry clerk in the Princeton postoffice, which
position he held until about ten years ago, when he was chosen teller of
the First National Bank. Later he was made cashier of the bank and
he has more than made good. Since his connection with the bank the
number of depositors has more than tripled and the deposits have more
than doubled. Colonel Flynn possesses an attribute valuable in all walks
of life, but more especially in the banking world—he has never touched
liquor of any kind. He is Treasurer of the Citizens’ Association, Treasurer
of the Princeton Militia Company, Treasurer of the Princeton Fish
and Game Association, chairman of the Committee on Collections of the
New Jersey Bankers’ Association, Past Grand Knight of the Knights of
Columbus and is publisher of the <cite>Bankers’ Loose Leaf Discount Ledger</cite>.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Garvan, Hon. Patrick</span>, 236 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, Conn. (A life
member of the Society and a member of the Executive Council.) He was
born in Ireland March 8, 1836, and came to this country in May, 1851,
and since 1852 has resided in Hartford. At the age of twenty-one Mr.
Garvan began his business career as a contractor and builder and continued
at the same for a period of twenty-one years. Many of the public
buildings and churches east of the Connecticut River were built by him
during this time. He was also a partner in a paper and paper stock business
carried on in Hartford under the name of E. J. Carroll &#38; Company.
From 1877 to 1906, having purchased the interest of Mr. Carroll, he conducted
under his own name a paper and paper stock business exclusively.
In 1906 the business was incorporated under the name of P. Garvan,
Inc., and is at the present time carried on under that name. It has
grown to such proportion that at the present time it occupies four warehouses
on State Street in Hartford, with offices at 205 and 207 State
Street, and one large storage plant at Holyoke, Mass. Recently the firm
has opened offices at 261 Broadway, New York City, and its interests are
cared for by Thomas F. Garvan, who has been associated with his father
for eighteen years. Mr. Garvan is also identified with several mills,
being President of the Eastern Straw Board Company at Versailles,
Conn., Hartford Board Company of Hartford, Conn., and the Newington
Paper Company of Newington, Conn. Three of his sons, Thomas F., Edward
J., and John S., are associated in business with him. Mr. Garvan
has always been a staunch Republican. During his residence in East
Hartford he held many positions of honor and trust, having been chairman
of the School Board of that town for twelve years; was President
of both Village Improvement and Street Lighting Associations; trustee
and Treasurer of the Raymond Library, and for several years chairman
of the Republican Town Committee. In 1884 he represented the town in
the House of Representatives, and was re-elected as its first representative
in 1885, serving as chairman of the School Fund Committee of that year,
and as a member of the Finance Committee in 1884. In 1890 he was
elected State Senator from the Second Senatorial District by the largest
Republican majority given any candidate in this district up to that time.
For some years <a id='t272'></a>previous to 1894 he was a member of the Republican State
Central Committee from the Second District, but resigned that office upon
his removal to Hartford. He was selected by the Connecticut Convention
as a delegate to the Republican Convention at Chicago which nominated
President Taft. When the Park Department of this city was reorganized,
the Legislature provided for the appointment of a commission to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>sole charge of this important work. Mr. Garvan was named as one of
the commissioners for the term of ten years. The Board of Park Commissioners
particularly entrusted to Commissioner Garvan the purchase of
lands for and the development of Riverside Park. In 1898, as President
of this board, he delivered the dedicatory address at the services attending
the opening of Riverside Park to the public. This park has become one
of the most useful pleasure grounds in this city, giving, as it does, a
place of recreation and rest for the poorer classes and children of the
East Side. Mr. Garvan has always taken a great interest in educational
matters, three of his sons having graduated from Yale University and
his daughters having finished their educations abroad. Two of his sons
entered the profession of law, Frank P. Garvan, the present Assistant
District Attorney of New York, and Edward J. Garvan, who was Judge
of the Hartford Police Court for five years. The latter is now identified
with his father’s business interests. Mr. Garvan enjoys the respect and
esteem of a very wide circle of friends and acquaintances, not only
throughout the State of Connecticut, but wherever his large business interests
extend. He is a self-made, practical business man, cautious, conservative
and strictly honorable in all his dealings, and through his native
genius and his untiring energy he has been uniformly successful in
all his business affairs. He is now a director of St. Francis Hospital,
director of the State Bank and the Riverside Trust Company; is a trustee
of the Society for Savings at Hartford and of the Cathedral parish,
Hartford. In January, 1861, Mr. Garvan married Miss Mary A. Carroll
of East Hartford, and ten children were born to them, eight of whom,
four sons and four daughters, are living at the present time. His wife
died in September, 1906.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Hanrahan, John D., M. D.</span>, Rutland, Vt., a native of County Limerick,
Ireland; was graduated in medicine from the University of the City of
New York, 1867; in June, 1861, he was, on examination (not having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>graduated), appointed surgeon in the United States Navy, and served
through the entire Civil War. The vessels on which he served did duty
mostly on the rivers of Virginia and North Carolina, where he served
with the army as well as the navy, thereby having the benefit and experience
of both branches of the service, especially in the surgical line. In
August, 1863, the vessel on which he was serving was captured at the
mouth of the Rappahannock River and all on board made prisoners.
They were taken overland to Richmond where they were confined in Libby
Prison. At that time the Confederates were very short of surgeons and
medical supplies, and he was asked if he would go over to Belle Island
and attend the Union prisoners. After consulting his fellow-prisoners he
consented, and for six weeks he attended the sick and wounded Union
prisoners faithfully, under very great disadvantages, as the appliances
were very limited. After that he was paroled. While a prisoner of war
he was treated with the greatest courtesy and consideration by the medical
staff and officers of the Confederacy. After the close of the war he was

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Kelly, Gertrude B., M. D.</span>, 130 East Twenty-seventh Street, New York City.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Kelly, John Forrest, Ph. D.</span>, Pittsfield, Mass.; born near Carrick-on-Suir,
Ireland. He was educated in Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken,
N. J., received the degree of B. L. in 1878 and that of Ph. D. in 1881.
His first occupation was as assistant to Thomas A. Edison, in Menlo
Park laboratory, his work then principally relating to the chemistry of
rare earths. Late in 1879 Mr. Kelly became electrical engineer of the
New York branch of the Western Electric Company. This was the time
when the telephone was being generally introduced, and when dynamos
were being first applied to telegraphic purposes. In the construction and
installment of instruments for telegraphy and telephones and of such
measuring instruments as were then known, Mr. Kelly received a thorough
training. In 1882 he became laboratory assistant to Edward Weston, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>chief electrician of the United States Electric Lighting Company, and,
with the exception of a year which he spent in connection with the Remingtons,
Mr. Kelly continued his association with Mr. Weston until July,
1886. Some of the most important work, such as the research which ended
in the discovery of high resistance alloys of very low or even negative
temperature co-efficients, were substantially carried out by Mr. Kelly under
general directions from Mr. Weston, whom Mr. Kelly succeeded as chief
electrician of the United States Electric Lighting Company, which, in
1889, passed to the Westinghouse interests; but Mr. Kelly retained his
position as chief electrician until January, 1892, when he resigned to join
William Stanley in experimental work. The work done by Mr. Kelly, in
this connection, gave a great impetus to the alternating current business.
Mr. Kelly’s inventive work is partially represented by eighty patents. The
art of building transformers and generators of alternating currents was
revolutionized, and Mr. Kelly and his colleagues were the first to put
polyphase motors into actual commercial service. That success naturally
led to long-distance transmission work, and the first long-distance transmission
plants in California (indeed the first in the world), were undertaken
on Mr. Kelly’s recommendation and advice. He was the first to
make a hysteretically stable steel, a matter of vastly more importance than
the comparatively spectacular transmission work. Mr. Kelly at present
occupies the position of President of the John F. Kelly Engineering Company,
President of the Cokel Company and President of the Telelectric
Company, as well as President of the Conchas River Power Company and
director of the Southwestern Exploration Company. The Cokel Company
is organized to exploit the invention of Mr. E. W. Cooke, by means of
which foodstuffs may be perfectly dehydrated, losing on the average ninety
per cent in weight. Foods dehydrated by this process, although free from
all chemical preservatives, are entirely stable, and yet preserve their pristine
freshness through extremes of temperature, and when served are
indistinguishable from fresh foods of the ordinary type. The Telelectric
Company is organized for the manufacture of electric piano players, which
are either entirely automatic or entirely controllable at will. Mr. Kelly
was married to Miss Helen Fischer, in New York City, in 1892, and they
have two children—Eoghan and Domnall. Mr. Kelly is a thorough and
unswerving Irish Nationalist, and his splendid generosity to the cause is
well-known.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Kelly, Joseph Thomas</span>, was born at Enniskeen, County Cavan, Ireland, January
3, 1887, and is the son of William and Anne (O’Connor) Kelly.
Removed in August, 1893, to New Haven, Conn.; in October, 1895, to
Union City, Conn.; in April, 1900, returned to New Haven. Educated
in Irish National Schools and in the public and parochial schools of the
United States; was graduated in 1903 from Hillhouse High School, New
Haven. In July, 1903, entered the employ of the New York, New Haven
and Hartford Railroad Company as a stenographer; and is at present
Secretary to the general counsel of that company. Member, Loyal Council

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Lonergan, Thomas S.</span>, 408 East One Hundred and Forty-ninth Street, New
York City, was born in Mitchelstown, Ireland, in the year 1864. He received
his early educational training from the Christian Brothers in his
native town and at St. Colman’s College, Fermoy. From early boyhood he
exhibited tokens of more than ordinary talents. He was fond of books, particularly
those on ancient and modern history, literature and biography. He
is today probably one of the best read men in Anglo-Irish literature and
Irish history in America; but he is by no means less informed on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>history, literature and politics of his adopted country, for he is an American
to the very backbone, and is proud of his citizenship. He came to
America in 1883, and lost no time in becoming a full-fledged American
citizen, immediately after which he affiliated himself with the Democratic
party. He had only been a citizen two weeks when, during the presidential
campaign of 1888, he was placed on the list of campaign speakers by
the Democratic State Committee of New York. In the early nineties, he
was an expert debater in the leading literary societies of New York. Previous
to that, he was a member of the Young Men’s Congress of Boston.
He is also a writer and lecturer of ability. His lectures on “Christian
Education,” “The Golden Age of Ireland,” “Charles Carroll, of Carrollton,”
“The American Stage,” “General Thomas Francis Meagher,” “Irishmen
in the American Revolution,” “Jefferson and Lincoln,” “The Catholic
Chapter in American History,” “The Irish Renaissance,” “St. Brendan,
America’s First Discoverer,” “Christian Democracy,” “Wendell Phillips,”
“Socialism and Individualism” and “Newfoundland and Her People,”
are masterpieces. His eulogy on Leo XIII is a classic. Mr. Lonergan
has been with the <cite>New York World</cite> for the past fifteen years, and is at
present manager of the Bronx office. He possesses not only literary but
executive abilities of a high order. During his residence in the Bronx he
has made hosts of friends and is well liked by all with whom he comes in
contact.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>McCarthy, Hon. Patrick Joseph</span>, Mayor of the city of Providence, R. I.,
1907 and 1908. Was born in County Sligo, Ireland, 1848, and was about
two years of age when his parents, Patrick and Alice (Cullen) McCarthy,
crossed the ocean. But they were destined to never reach the mainland
of free America, for both father and mother died while waiting in quarantine,
at Deer Island, Boston Harbor. Patrick J. was the youngest of
seven sons. He became the ward of a society connected with the Catholic
Cathedral in Boston, and remained with this society until he was
eight years old. During this time he attended the public schools. Winters
of following years, until he was fourteen, he attended day school in
Somerville, Mass., and night school at Cambridge. About this time Professor
Charles Elliot Norton, and some of his college associates, one of
whom was Charles William Eliot, ex-President of Harvard University,
organized a night school in old Cambridge for working boys, and admitted
boys residing in Somerville. Advantage of this opportunity was
taken and whenever speaking of this period of his life, Mayor McCarthy
expresses his admiration and gratitude for Professor Norton. It was this
association with true men that did more to mould his character and direct
his mind and thoughts in the right direction than any other influence of
his youth. In 1863 he removed to Providence, and while making his home
with his brother learned the trade of brass finisher. His ambition was
to become master of a business on his own account, and encouraged by
a few successful ventures in real estate, determined to qualify himself
for business in a proper manner. Realizing that a knowledge of law
would be of great advantage to him, he read and studied Blackstone’s
and Kent’s Commentaries on Law and made up his mind to choose law
as a profession instead of engaging in business, and after suitable preparation
entered the Law School of Harvard University. His accumulated
savings supported him during the time of the course of study, and he
graduated with the degree of LL. B. in 1876. Returning to Providence,
Mr. McCarthy was admitted to the Bar of Rhode Island. He was soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>possessed of a good clientage, and later was admitted to the Circuit Court
and Supreme Court of the United States. Being an ardent reader and
endowed with histrionic ability, the stage appealed to him, and his evenings
were spent in the congenial society of those interested in amateur
theatricals, Shakespearian readings, etc., and notwithstanding his preference
for serious characters, was frequently cast for the comedian’s part.
In 1875 he married Miss Anne M. McGinney, of Providence, but this
happy union was of short duration, as she died in 1880, leaving one of
three children, Mary Josephine, wife of William H. Bannon, of Central
Falls, R. I., surviving her. Although a Democrat, Mr. McCarthy has
always been a firm believer in the principles of equitable protection, reciprocity
and sound money. He was frequently urged to accept nomination
for various public offices, but persistently declined until the fall of 1889,
when he was nominated on a fusion ticket and elected to the Providence
City Council, where he served during the years 1890–1892 and 1894. In
1891, 1892 and 1903 he was elected to the House of Representatives of
Rhode Island, and made a good record in the Legislature. He was
opposed to granting special privileges to public service corporations without
adequate compensation to the public for franchises in public highways.
In November, 1906, he was elected Mayor of the city of Providence,
and the best tribute to his first year’s record in that office is
that he was re-elected in 1907 by a greatly increased plurality. While
Mayor McCarthy is a firm believer in the principles of Democracy and
appreciative of the honors the Democratic party has conferred on him,
he has always felt it to be his first duty to observe the wishes of
the people as a whole, rather than those of a party or faction. He
has been fearless in his disregard of partisanship and has won the
respect and admiration of all good citizens by his official acts as Mayor.
Mr. McCarthy is a many-sided man. As an official he is conspicuously
successful. He has always represented the whole people, and never attempted
to gain favor by the sacrifice of principle. He is a sound lawyer,
enjoying the respect of the Court and the confidence of his clients. Better
than that, he is a true friend, warm-hearted, clear-headed and helpful,
and a loyal, patriotic American citizen. Address, 49 Westminster
Street, Providence, R. I. Is Vice-President of the Society for Rhode
Island.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>McClure, Hon. David</span>, attorney at law, 22 William Street, New York City.
Mr. McClure was admitted to the bar in December, 1869, in New York
City, where he has since resided. His practice has brought him very prominently
before the courts and public during the last thirty-six years as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>counsel in cases which have attracted much attention. He has been counsel
in many contested will cases, including those of Merrill, Schuyler
Skatts, Charles B. Beck and Mary Johnson. In the Livingston, De Meli
and General Burnside litigation he was also prominent. He has been connected
with many large corporation foreclosure suits, including those of
the Denver Water Company, the New York &#38; Northern Railroad Company,
Omaha Water Company, the Toledo, Ann Arbor &#38; Northern Michigan,
the Northern Pacific, the New York, Lake Erie &#38; Western, the Oregon
Railway &#38; Navigation Company, the Oregon Improvement Company,
the Chicago &#38; Northern Pacific Company, the Bankers and Merchants’
Telegraph Company, and the Memphis &#38; Charleston Railroad Company.
He is regarded as one of the most successful trial lawyers at the bar in
New York. Mr. McClure for more than a quarter of a century has been
counsel for the Farmers Loan &#38; Trust Company, the oldest and largest
trust company in the United States, organized in 1821; and for many years
of the Consolidated Gas Company, one of the largest public service corporations
in the country. He is also counsel for the West Side Savings
Bank, several fire insurance companies and other banks. He was one of
the counsel for the Mutual Life Insurance Company during the presidency
of F. S. Winston. For years he was a director in the Lawyers Surety
Company, and he is on the board of the Title Insurance Company of New
York. He was a prominent and active member of the State Constitution
Convention of 1894, in which body he introduced and carried through the
amendment providing for protection of the forests of New York. He years
ago declined elevation to the bench of the Court of Appeals, the highest
court in the state of New York, and several times to other positions;
also appointment to the offices of corporation counsel of the city of New
York, and district attorney of the United States. Mr. McClure was appointed,
in 1893, receiver of the National Bank of Deposit, in the city of
New York, and in spite of the stringent financial condition which prevailed
during the summer of that year, dividends aggregating seventy-five
per cent were paid within three months. The entire indebtedness, principal
and interest, was paid and the receivership closed out within one year.
In 1892 he was a delegate from the State of New York to the National
Democratic Convention which, at Chicago, nominated Grover Cleveland
as candidate for the office of President of the United States, and during
the campaign of that year he was much discussed by the press of New
York as the probable nominee of his party for the office of Mayor of the
city. In that year he was designated by the General Term of the Supreme
Court, chairman of the first commission appointed to determine
whether a subway passing under Broadway and other streets through the
city should be constructed, his associates being Robert Maclay, President
of the Knickerbocker Trust Company, and Benjamin Perkins. Prior to
the adoption by the United States government of the Panama Canal project,
and during the Presidency of Mr. McKinley, one of the largest, if not
the largest, syndicates of moneyed men ever gathered together obtained a
concession from the government of Nicaragua for the construction of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>canal known as the Nicaragua Canal. This syndicate, which proposed to
build the canal without government aid, was composed of the Messrs.
Vanderbilt, Astor, Rockefeller, Mills, Stillman, Grace, Crimmins, and
others of equal standing, and was represented before the committee of
Congress upon the question of recognition and protection, by Mr. McClure
as its counsel, he having organized the corporation under which it
was proposed to operate. Mr. McClure is a member of the Manhattan,
New York Athletic and other clubs, and the Bar Association, of which
he has been a member of the judiciary and other committees. He has
also been honored with the presidency of the Metropolitan Surety
Company.</p>

N. W., Washington, D. C. (Life member of the Society.) He was born
at Port Penn, Del., August 4, 1843. He is the son of John and Catherine
(Caldwell) McGowan. He was educated in the public schools of Philadelphia,
Pa., 1848–’53, and in private schools in Elizabeth, N. J., 1854–’59.
Entering the navy, he was appointed acting master’s mate, March 8,
1862; was promoted to acting master May 8, 1862, and ordered to command
the U. S. S. <em>Wyandank</em> in the Potomac flotilla. He served on the
Potomac and Rappahannock rivers until February, 1863, when he was detached
from the <em>Wyandank</em> and ordered to the <em>Florida</em> as navigator. He
served on the <em>Florida</em> in the blockage off Wilmington, N. C., until October,
1864, when the ship went to New York for repairs. In November, of the
same year, he was detached from the <em>Florida</em> and ordered to the U. S. S.
<em>State of Georgia</em> as navigator; arrived off Wilmington, N. C., the day
after the capture of Fort Fisher, his ship being then ordered to reinforce
the fleet off Charleston, S. C. While there he took part in the Bulls Bay
Expedition, which was one of the causes of the evacuation of Charleston
by the Confederates. Soon after the evacuation, the <em>State of Georgia</em> was
ordered to Aspinwall (Colon) to protect American interests on the Isthmus
of Panama. Before sailing for Aspinwall, McGowan succeeded
Lieutenant Manly as executive officer of the ship. In November, 1865, he
was ordered to the U. S. S. <em>Monongahela</em> as watch and division officer;
served on the <em>Monongahela</em> in the West Indies until January, 1867, when
he was detached and, a few days later, joined the U. S. S. <em>Tacony</em>, Commander
Roe, fitting out for duty in the Gulf Squadron. He was at Vera
Cruz nearly all the summer of 1867, which witnessed the fall of Maximilian’s

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>O’Leary, Rev. Cornelius F.</span>, Wellston, Mo., was born in the parish of Lixnan,
County Kerry, Ireland, on the 20th of July, 1850; is the son of Cornelius
O’Leary and Jane Stack, being the seventh and last child of the family;
has ever felt a pride in being descended from the O’Learys and McSheehys
on the one side and Stacks and O’Connors on the other—names held in
honor and respect throughout the classic Kingdom of Ireland. From
early youth he attended the national schools of the parish, and later was
afforded the blessing and superior advantage of an education at the
hands of the Christian Brothers of Tralee. At fifteen years of age he
was induced by his honorable cousin, Thomas R. Wilson, Attorney at
Killarney, to enter his office and prepare for the study of law. He soon
grew discontented with the tedious forms and complexities of the law, returned
to Tralee and entered the Classical School conducted by Charles
McCarthy, a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. At seventeen, it next
became his fortune to come to America and he settled in the West, “Where
the mighty Missouri rolls down to the sea.” With true Irish courage he
accommodated himself to circumstances, looked neither to the right or to
the left until he reached the goal of his pious ambition, receiving Holy
Orders at the hands of Archbishop Ryan, then of St. Louis, in May, 1873.

Was born in Ireland, and came to America at a very early age with his
parents. After learning the machinery trade in Binghamton, he went
West and engaged in mining in California. Retiring to Binghamton, he
went into the grocery business and real estate business and bought a controlling
interest in a Democratic paper, which naturally brought him into
politics. Never having had any taste for public office, he was, however,
named as a presidential elector in 1892 for Grover Cleveland. He was
appointed a member of the state committee, and served as a commissioner
for the World’s Fair at Chicago by appointment of Governor Flower of
New York. Having confidence in the growth of Binghamton, he became
interested in its progress and general development. He became a stockholder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>in the electric light plant, a director in the First National Bank,
and a trustee of the Susquehanna Valley Savings Bank. He is a prominent
member of the Chamber of Commerce and attends to his large real
estate investments, being at the present time the largest tax-payer in the
city of Binghamton and county of Broome.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>O’Shea, D. G.</span>, Red Lodge, Montana, born near Bantry, Ireland, February 6,
1862, of native parents. Attended the rudimentary schools of the locality
until 13 years of age; then employed for six years in a small mercantile
establishment in the town of Bantry. Hon. T. M. Healy was at that time
a clerk in this store, and one of Mr. O’Shea’s instructors at the Bantry
school was Hon. Timothy Harrington, later a prominent member of the
Irish Parliamentary party, and also Lord Mayor of Dublin. Bantry being
a town where the revolutionary spirit was much in evidence, there was a
secret society there of which Mr. O’Shea became a member while still a
boy; he also participated actively in the doings of the Land League. He
came to America in March, 1881, and after several months of searching
about for a suitable opening, settled in Montana, where he has since resided.
The state was then very sparsely settled, and there were no railroads.
Mr. O’Shea spent some time in prospecting and working in mines,
etc., and in 1887 went to Red Lodge with the pioneers of that locality.
He entered the employ of the Rocky Fork Coal Company, remaining with
that concern for 15 years until it was absorbed by the Northern Pacific
Railway. He then engaged in banking and real estate, and has since been
connected with affairs of that nature. He was married in 1901 to Miss
Eleanor Cavenagh, a native of Dublin, and at that time living in Chicago.
There are three children, two boys and a girl.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Quinlan, Francis J., A. M., M. D., LL. D.</span>, eighth President-General of the
American Irish Historical Society, was born in the City of New York,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>December 24th, 1853. Both his parents were Irish born, coming to these
shores when the great exodus took place, about 1845. His early education
was obtained at the Parochial School of St. Francis Xavier, under
the guidance of the Christian Brothers. Later he attended Manhattan
Academy, then at Thirty-second Street, and afterwards the College of St.
Francis Xavier. While preparing for the study of medicine he taught
school. In 1878 he was graduated from the College of Physicians and
Surgeons, Columbia College, and soon after accepted an appointment at
St. Vincent’s Hospital, which he shortly resigned to enter the United
States Indian Service, serving on the frontier four years. In 1883 Doctor
Quinlan returned to New York and devoted himself especially to
diseases of the ear, nose and throat. Such was the skill he displayed that
in a comparatively few years he was among the most prominent of
his profession and today is a recognized authority in his specialty.
Doctor Quinlan’s prominence in the medical field is attested by the
number of important posts he holds. He is Professor of diseases of the
nose and throat in the medical department of Fordham University and
the New York Polyclinic; attending Laryngologist and Otologist to the
New York City and the St. Vincent Hospitals; Consulting Throat and
Nose Surgeon of the New York Foundling Hospital, St. Joseph’s Hospital,
Yonkers, and Jamaica Hospital, N. Y., and Consulting Ear, Throat
and Nose Surgeon of St. Agnes Hospital, White Plains, N. Y. He is
President of the New York Celtic Medical Society, Fellow of the New
York Academy of Medicine, a member of the American Medical and the
State Medical Associations, the New York Otological and the Medico
Surgical Societies, the Society of Medical Jurisprudence and a former
President of the New York County Medical Association. In addition to
these organizations of his profession, he is President of the Alumni Sodality
of the College of St. Francis Xavier; is a member of the society
of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, the Catholic Club of New York, of
which he is a former President, the Manhattan, New York Athletic and
Lambs’ Clubs and is connected with various religious, racial and charitable
organizations of New York City. Doctor Quinlan is a liberal contributor
to the periodicals of his department of medicine and has devised many
ingenious surgical instruments. Since his election to the office of President-General,
the American Irish Historical Society has steadily gained
favor with our people, and it is safe to say that the increase of three
hundred members since he has been at the head of the Society is due in
a great measure to his untiring efforts and a genial disposition which earns
for him wherever he goes a host of friends. As an orator Doctor Quinlan
is above mediocrity. His delivery is enthusiastic and has the true
ring of sincerity, carrying along conviction. Especially was this noticeable
in his addresses delivered at Washington and Providence. Doctor
Quinlan is an ardent lover of the beautiful in nature, and is an
art enthusiast, and although one of the busiest men in the great metropolis,
he manages occasionally to find leisure to examine rare pieces
of art that have found their way to the art collector’s, and to add to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>already large collection of statuary and paintings. So judicious is the
taste he displays that he is regarded as a connoisseur, and his artistic opinion
has, on various occasions, been solicited. In 1906 Doctor Quinlan
was the recipient of the Lætare Medal.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Sheehan, Hon. William Francis</span>, 16 East Fifty-sixth Street, New York City,
was born in the City of Buffalo, N. Y., of Irish parents, on November
6, 1859. His father, William Sheehan, and his mother, Honora Crowley,
were born in Cork, Ireland. At an early age both came to this country.
He was educated in the public schools and graduated from St. Joseph’s
College, Buffalo. He was admitted to the Bar in 1881, and practised law
in Buffalo for thirteen years. At the same time he was active in politics,
and became the leader of the Democratic party in Erie County, and in the
western part of the State. He was elected a member of the New York Assembly
from Erie County in the year 1884 and was successively elected in
each of the six ensuing years, thus having had seven years of service in
the Assembly, during six years of which he was Democratic leader. In
1891 he was the Speaker of the Assembly. In the fall of 1891 he was
elected Lieutenant-Governor on the Democratic State ticket, with Roswell
P. Flower as Governor, and was therefore presiding officer of the Senate
for the years 1892, 1893 and 1894. He was the New York representative
on the Democratic National Committee from 1891 to 1896. At the end of
his term as Lieutenant-Governor, Mr. Sheehan removed to New York City
and there engaged in the practice of his profession as senior member of
the firm of Sheehan &#38; Collin. In the fall of 1905 the firm of Sheehan &#38;
Collin was dissolved and Mr. Sheehan joined with former Judge Alton B.
Parker, former Judge Edward W. Hatch and with Charles H. Werner,
Esquire, in organizing the law firm of Parker, Hatch &#38; Sheehan. Mr.
Sheehan is a member of the following clubs: Metropolitan, Manhattan,
Downtown, City, Midday, Railroad and Automobile Club of America. He

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Sullivan, James J.</span>, attorney at law, Ernest &#38; Cranmer Building, Denver, Col.,
was born in Auniscaule, County Kerry, Ireland, March 1, 1875, is the son
of John Sullivan and Mary Lynch, and a descendant of the ancient O’Sullivan
clan of the “Kingdom of Kerry.” His father died in Ireland in
1883, and the following spring his mother brought seven of her orphaned
children to America, settling in Holyoke, Mass., which is still regarded as
the family home. At the age of fourteen, Mr. Sullivan was compelled to
leave school to become a breadwinner on his own account. Three years
later he was enabled to return to school, and entered the Holyoke High
School in 1892, and at the same time began the study of law in the office
of Hon. Christopher T. Callahan of Holyoke. For the next four years
he pursued both his high school and law courses, graduating from the
High school in June, 1896, and was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>October of the same year. So far as now known, this is the first time in
the history of Massachusetts high schools when one of the students was
admitted to the practice of any of the learned professions the same year
of graduation. He immediately formed a partnership with Mr. Callahan,
which continued until January, 1900. A few months prior to this time,
Mr. Sullivan had occasion to visit the Far West, as a result of which he
determined to dissolve his Eastern partnership and move permanently to
Colorado with its vast wealth of undeveloped resources. With no assets
except a willingness to work, he took up the practice of his profession in
Denver in the spring of 1900. He has succeeded in building up an extensive
practice, principally in matters relating to irrigation. Mr. Sullivan
is one of the few young men raised in America who speaks the Irish tongue
fluently. He is a member of several clubs, an enthusiastic horseman and
all-around sportsman; is passionately loyal to his friends and possesses to a
very large degree “that characteristic Irish pertinacity that never saw night
too dark, hour too late or road too rough to interfere with rendering a
favor to a friend—or a blow to an enemy.”</p>
